**GOLDS Marketing Department 2025-12-10**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Challenges in Offer Tracking and Franchise Collaboration:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed significant challenges in tracking offers, measuring success, and collaborating with franchisees, highlighting the lack of systemization and visibility that impedes national-scale initiatives and effective partnerships with brands and agencies such as W Promote.

- - **Offer Tracking Limitations:** Teams Hub 1 explained that there is no effective methodology to track member engagement with offers, such as referral systems or affiliate programs, which restricts the ability to scale initiatives nationally and prevents partnerships with large brands from being executed efficiently.
    - **Franchisee Visibility Issues:** The group noted that franchisees often lack clarity on what constitutes success, leading to inconsistent execution and a 'he said, she said' environment, which is exacerbated by the absence of centralized reporting and oversight.
    - **Agency Collaboration Barriers:** Teams Hub 1 described how the new media agency, W Promote, faces difficulties in advising franchisees due to limited visibility into key metrics such as membership needs and churn rates, further complicating media spend and campaign planning.
    - **National Fund and Media Spend:** It was clarified that while a national fund supports upper-funnel marketing activities, there is a lack of visibility into conversions at the gym level, as data is not integrated beyond the initial click, limiting the effectiveness of national campaigns.
- **Data Visibility, Attribution, and CRM Limitations:**

Teams Hub 1 outlined the current limitations in data visibility, attribution, and CRM integration, emphasizing the inability to track member journeys from lead to conversion and the absence of automation and segmentation needed for performance-driven marketing.

- - **Attribution Gaps:** The team highlighted that they cannot attribute specific ads to in-gym sign-ups due to the lack of segmentation and integration between marketing and gym management systems, resulting in missed opportunities for targeted follow-up and performance measurement.
    - **CRM and Marketing Automation Shortcomings:** Teams Hub 1 stated that their CRM and marketing automation systems are not optimized to collect or utilize member data beyond the initial engagement, preventing the brand from reaching the entire member base with unified messaging.
    - **Retargeting and Audience Enrichment:** The group discussed ongoing efforts to improve retargeting in collaboration with W Promote, but noted that the absence of a Customer Data Platform (CDP) and audience enrichment tools limits their ability to execute advanced retargeting strategies.
    - **Forecasting and Measurement Challenges:** It was mentioned that the current measurement approach is primarily retrospective, lacking the forecasting capabilities needed to understand the impact of daily membership fluctuations on monthly targets.
- **Cost Per Acquisition and Media Optimization:**

Teams Hub 1 and other participants reviewed cost per acquisition (CAC) trends, industry benchmarks, and the impact of media agency strategies on performance, noting the need for improved optimization and the influence of gym age and market factors.

- - **CAC Trends and Benchmarks:** Teams Hub 1 reported that CAC has ranged from \$88 to \$125 depending on the time of year and market conditions, and compared these figures to industry standards, with SNAP running around \$77 and other brands targeting \$60-\$70 per join.
    - **Media Agency Strategy Shifts:** The group described how previous media agencies applied uniform strategies across all gyms, but the current approach involves more targeted spending, especially for underperforming or older gyms, to improve conversion rates.
    - **Lead Versus Join Metrics:** It was clarified that the team primarily tracks CAC rather than cost per lead, due to limitations in automation and follow-up processes at the gym level, though efforts are underway to improve direct communication and lead management.
- **Sales Process Evolution and Member Engagement:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed the shift from traditional in-gym sales processes to more centralized and digital approaches, the need for balancing personal engagement with automation, and the importance of effective follow-up to convert trials into memberships.

- - **Centralization of Sales:** The team described the transition from decentralized, high-touch in-gym sales to more centralized member management, noting that the current system is still evolving and not yet fully effective.
    - **Balancing Automation and Personal Touch:** Teams Hub 1 emphasized the need to balance digital automation with in-person engagement, as some members require additional encouragement and follow-up to convert from trial passes to full memberships.
    - **Follow-Up Limitations:** It was noted that follow-up is currently limited to email touchpoints, with no SMS capability, which is seen as a significant barrier to effective member engagement and conversion.
- **SMS Communication Barriers and Legal Concerns:**

Teams Hub 1 explored the obstacles to implementing SMS follow-up in member journeys, focusing on legal compliance, opt-in/opt-out management, and the lack of a unified system of record for communication preferences.

- - **Legal Risks and Compliance:** The group recounted incidents where franchisees inadvertently sent SMS notifications to members who had opted out, resulting in legal challenges and prompting the legal team to restrict SMS usage until a compliant solution is found.
    - **Opt-In/Opt-Out Management:** Teams Hub 1 discussed the fragmented nature of opt-in/opt-out tracking across different systems, with no global management in place, leading to inconsistencies and increased legal risk.
    - **System Integration Challenges:** It was highlighted that changes to communication preferences in one system (e.g., gym management software) are not communicated to others, making it difficult to ensure compliance and effective member communication.
- **Manual Processes for Promotions and Affiliate Programs:**

Teams Hub 1 described the manual and time-consuming nature of managing promotional codes, referral programs, and affiliate partnerships, which limits scalability and the ability to track and reward member and influencer participation.

- - **Manual Promotion Management:** The team explained that setting up and managing promotional codes and referral programs requires significant manual effort from both their team and Ryan's team, making it difficult to scale these initiatives.
    - **Affiliate Program Limitations:** It was noted that the lack of system integration prevents effective tracking and compensation for influencer-driven campaigns, as franchise gyms may not honor codes or use compatible systems.
- **Customer Data Platform (CDP) Evaluation and Data Challenges:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed ongoing evaluations of CDP solutions, such as Treasure Data, and identified key challenges related to data cleanliness, normalization, and the need for education on the benefits and practical applications of a CDP.

- - **CDP Platform Considerations:** The group shared that they have had discussions about platforms like Treasure Data, but emphasized that broader understanding and buy-in are needed before moving forward with implementation.
    - **Data Cleanliness and Normalization:** Teams Hub 1 identified data cleanliness and normalization as foundational issues that must be addressed before a CDP can deliver value, noting that current data is not always malleable or predictive.
    - **Education and Expectations:** The team recognized the need to educate stakeholders on what a CDP can realistically achieve, suggesting the use of tangible examples to illustrate member journeys and the potential for improved targeting and engagement.
- **Next Steps and Action Items for Unified System Planning:**

Teams Hub 1 agreed to follow up with a written summary of key issues, non-negotiables, and departmental requirements for a unified system, with plans to consolidate input across departments and continue the project through ongoing meetings and validation.

- - **Written Follow-Up Request:** Teams Hub 1 was asked to provide an email summary of the four main problem areas and to outline non-negotiable requirements for the new technology stack, to be shared with the group for further planning.
    - **Departmental Input Consolidation:** The plan includes collecting non-negotiable requirements from each department, layering them with existing ecosystem maps, and validating them with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
    - **Ongoing Project Structure:** It was agreed that this initiative will involve multiple conversations and touchpoints, both in-person and via Teams meetings, with IT driving technology-focused projects and other departments contributing based on business needs.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Documentation of Issues and Requirements:** Send an email summarizing the four main issues/problem areas discussed, along with a list of non-negotiables and requirements for a unified system and new tech stack for the department. (Jake)
- **Departmental Non-Negotiables Collection:** Provide any additional thoughts or items that were not voiced during the meeting but are relevant to the department's needs for the new system in the same follow-up email. (Jake)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

thing from offer driving to consolidation of information and reporting to just what are now commonplace methodologies with referral systems affiliate programs, etc, and what you're seeing at a health and fitness level. which keeps us from doing broad scale national opportunities with bigger collaborative brands for reach, that can kind of, you know, kind of buy in, say if we wanted to work with an old spice, for example, and they wanted to subsidize a monthly offer, there's zero way we could do that, right? And we've come across different programs where a group like acorns for a measurement standpoint of if a member downloads acorns and funds it for $50 acorns will kick back a free PT session on on their behalf. There's no methodology to track it so that leaves us doing things in a small way in gym where we can't reach the entire member base, where we don't have visibility and offer driving or what success looks like. And when you're dealing with franchisees, you actually don't know what success looks like, that becomes a real issue because it becomes a he said she said Ka environment. We're experiencing that now with our new media agency, which is W Promote, is that they are talking with our franchisees who are wanting to come on board. And of course, the first. they want to understand how much they should spend and where and W promotes the initial ask is, well, how many memberships do you need and what's your turn rate? And they're running into issues on visibility or not even that. And understanding. So there is a comprehensive, like God's eye view oversight that we don't have in a systemization or productization that we don't have, which leads into everything from we can't reach our entire domestic, let alone an international member base, with one click. And we should. If we wanted to run some sort of overarching offer that benefits the members or benefits, the gyms as a whole are the brand. And we have no visibility of the attraction of those things. So I would start, if we wanted, say, broad view, it's that. So we can we can work with the company owned gym members and then hope that the franchisees activate it. But we have no visibility in any of that beyond. So we're not really operating as a brand. Gotcha. Do you both siege just support corporate or how do you interface with the franchise network, I guess? So, from a national fund, so, like, they pay into traditional national fund, right? And so we're running everything from PPC to Meta to whatever, to drive upper funnel traffic because we can't see beyond into when somebody goes in and actually converts yet. Whether it's a lead or not, we only see to a click point, and then once it goes into their gym management system, we don't have in visibility into it. And because we're not optimized to collect any of that information in our CRM and marketing automation, we're not reaching them as in aiverging for hand. Right. But up to that point, you do have that information, your tracking the campaigns and you can get, you know. Which measurement is a whole other revamp for us? Like, just visibility and forecasting. A lot of what we have is a look back, not a look forward in terms of if you miss, if we miss today by two memberships, what does it impact by the end of the month? Like, what do we what is that clear makeup based on forecasting? We don't have that yet. And so we're working towards that. And then just the attribution back, because being able to tell, you know, that this person was impacted by an ag that led to a walk in, that led to a sign up inside of the gym. We don't don't have that segmentation yet. Oh, so you don't have, like a free pass attribution or joint online attribution? That's not being captured right now. They're not connected. They're connected. Oh, okay, okay. So you even do retargeting then? Because you just get retarget for the rest of your life? Yeah, I know. Well, we're retargeting to the best of our abilities and working with W promot on that on how we get there. But yeah, it's a difficult challenge, especially because we don't have that CDP or leveraging something like a live ramp, we will be, but we have no audience enrichment right now that will allow us to kind of really push that out. So, yeah. Makes sense. On the corporate side of the equation, you obviously. We can see more there, because we can see. So we are ret targeting there. But we leave the retargeting, and so everything that we're doing at a national level is either intent-based conversion based on branded terms or we're way up a funnel in awareness or traffic driving and then they're responsible for the retargeting and conversion pieces in their media budgets. Oh, they are? Yeah, like the individual Yeah. And do they have a choice of agencies? Yeah, right now they do. They can choose anybody? approved by golds or.. No, they can choose everybody. Okay. But that's. Yeah, that's. We're trying to funnel everybody into W Promote right now. Just curious, what you think Kakus? I think I think kak is right around. Well, it'll be dependent, right? Because you've got heavy spins coming in January. Would we forecast at CA to be. When I came in, it was like $88. But it's proving like in January, February, March, more like 125. Some of it because of our setup, were not as optimized for perforance as what we'd need to be, but the other piece of it is just, you know, where we are, the density, the ages of some of the gyms that we have, there are about 13 gyms that underperform and that's just due to age and that kind of stuff. But we haven't our previous media agency wasn't steering towards that, so in some cases, and I'll use Anderson Harbor as an example, like we can funnel in as much money as we want to into that one. It doesn't mean it's going to convert any better. And so our medi agency, though, was flighting, previous media agency was flighting everything the same. And so we've taken a different approach to even push past compassion in some cases on the newer lands, just so we can get the proper proper groupings. What's industry standard on average these days? For what should it be? Yeah, the cost for acquisition. So Snap was running around 77. 77? Yeah, and so a lot of the brands I work with, we do cost per lead and cost per join. Yeah. You know, and, you know, cost per lead, 25, and then, you know, maybe 60 or something, 70 maybe, on that cost per joint. Yeah. Depends on market. you can't put it down. Right. W promotes pretty competent that we get to 70 this year. Yeah. And then we'll work on refinement down there. They're like, there's no way that you should be playing. And I agree with them, like that we should be above 100 bes in some cases, we will be, because there's competitive conquesting that's involved. Right. Do you track costs per lead or just the cost of the CA? We're just the CA. Okay. Because we haven't had now that we're installing at a gym level base for the GMs and the AGMs and the front desk to be able to tackle like direct communication on the lead portion. to drive them in, the automation wasn't there to follow up to the extent that what we want one and two from a follow up standpoint. So it's a kind of what is it a clash of two worlds? Because if you walked into a gold, what, six years ago, seven years ago, it was you walk in, you sit down with an AGM, they saw you. Here's the whole sales process. Or if you do a free pass to walk in, you're getting heavy phone calls and things like that and RSG group got completely away from that and went all digital. And there's a marriage of both of those things. It has to happen from an experien standpoint. right, right. things more centralized now with the centralized member managers, I guess, right? Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I mean, that's still a work in progress. It's not quite, I think, where we want it to be to be as effective as it could be. I think more importantly is where that pendulum swing so far to the we just run the front desk and keep a clean club and walk into her, no pressure sales. 2026 budget, there's an accountability there for driving sales and revenue to the gym, that they'll be held accountable for. So the aspect of people in gym, not just the CMAs, but people in gym, actively selling more so than they have, we're not going back to salespe, and teams of salespeople and gyms, but that is. Depends on the swinging just a little bit. Yeah. It needs to balance. Yeah, it. Come back the other ball bit. Yeah. Fitness is, you, it's an interesting product because a lot of people don't really want to buy it. It's not like a burger immediate gratification or whatever. They kind of have to be pushed across. Others will buy it, you know, write online or whatever, but others like, I need a little push. They're There's varying degrees, like, and what we're seeing is even with an offer, like if we're doing pay nothing until January, we're still seeing people take the trial one day pass first to test it out, or multiple day passes to test it out to then then come in and say, "H, we want to do it." Experience it fget, feel it? Yeah. Yeah.. And how good of a job are we in massaging that one day pass and connecting with those individuals that areucing ourselves, following up with, you and getting them in the moment of, you, I'm ready to join. Yeah, so for my perspective, we're coming closer and closer to that, but it's been at an email touch point, right? Like we don't have SMS, which is terrible place to be. A terrible place to be. So when when I was on your side and we were working with State Farm on their app and their processes that used to be whenever you want to quote, you hit it in an agent calls you within 90 seconds, right? And the options for those were like a single digit percentages, they kept going down year over year, and it was behaviorally and emotionally once you got to a certain threshold, there's an age category that just does not want to receive phone calls. It gives them high anxiety. And just by switching to SMS, we increase the optins by 322%. And so the fact that we don't have an SMS follow up on this journey is a significant barrier for us, I believe. What is our obstacle with SMS today? It's illegal. It'segal. What's funny is when I did it for Tamp's SNS. So I must have went directly to her website. You did? Yeah. Yeah, they're doing their own thing. That's upon his banking that goes trying to tell you. What aspect of legal is blocking? Optin, opt out, and then just visibility and accountability on as responsible. So we had a franchisee. Something went sideways on their list and they ended up sending out SMS notifications to people who had opted out and "Here comes the demand letters. And so our legal matressly freezes up. Everybodybody off. So Unt until we can find a a solution, so Yeah, I think pivoting unless they've explicitly opted in, we cannot reach out, even though it was a customer initiated, a potential customer initiated sequence, where we probably don't have the obligation yet for opt to or opt out to at least respond or what have you. It be included immediately and they're slower, you know, to give us a little bit to explore than, you. And Hubspot is the CRM. Hub is the CRM and marketing automation. It used to be sales forces prior to the acquisition. And we get using Tulio or something like that for the actual SMS. Yes. So the optins, opt outs with Moso, do people opt in opt out inside of Moso or where do they do this opt in opt out? Which system of record there is. Does that initiate? Yeah. Well, I think that's part of the problem is is it really a system of records. That's kind of where legal. Join line is prevalent now, so we have the ability to add that language there. We haven't just yet. to opt in. All the all the gym management systems, motions often included, all have flags, right? Opt in, typically, it's opt in for, like, the primary communications is opting in for the, you, additional marketing type stuff or whatever. So whether typically, our memberships aren't sold in by salesperson, so they're not asking that question and flagging in appropriately. If they do, they're probably just leaving it blank. by default, it's not being flagged. And again, there's no global opt out management in place that's part of Legal's concern is, okay, you opt in through the website, when you join, great, but then you walk into Moso one day and say, I'm tired of these emails. You walk into your gym and say, "Hey, can you stop doing this?" They changed the flag there. It doesn't communicate to. Well, and it doesn't, like. You have those pieces and then it is still very cumbersome and highly manual to do things like promotional codes, which we're just recently got the ability to do. And so when you think about whether we want to do referral codes for current members, right, on a rewards basis, I refer you, you stay three months, I get a free month, or if I just want to say, like, you's a win back program, you use this promo, like it's still a very, like manual time consuming thing for both our team and Ryan's team to come together to do. And then ideally, what we want to do in a perfect world, but we can't because of the ubiquity of social, is affiliate programs with larger gym influencers or bringing more smallase influencers into our ecosystem because if somebody with a national audience says join Gold and use my code for a 10% off or whatever it is, if they walk into a franchise gym, they may not be honoring or with that coder at a different system, and then there's no trackability back to that creator getting paid off of that deal. And so it's very challenging for us to be able to do that's why everything is isolated. It's like, company I Jim's here and then the franchisees are kind of doing their own thing at a localized level and we want to bring it all consolidated for the benefit of everybody. This is a rising ties lift all ships type of situation. So I've heard CDP thrown around. Have you guys looked at different platforms? Yeah. Which ones? I know that we've had considerable talks early on when Alex and I got here on Treasure Data. They seem to be one of the three, but, like, until there's a finer understanding of for everybody in terms of why we need this, I think that there was a magical moment, it was our first kind of all group gathering over there, where everybody was like, and we'll be able to retar. We'll be able to do all of these things. And Alex and I kind of looked at each around and like, you know, it's not the website that does that. It's like all the other things that go into, like that's important and go underneath that. And I think that there's a vast amount of education around this. Like, you know, ultimate goal is we'd like to operate more as a retail media network, right? We where we can have agencies or larger brands plug in, we run everything through our screens and our generating revenue that way. We just can't get these basic promotional pieces right now across the port. And so we ideally I'd love to have that. There were some franchisees that set up Hubspot in a pseudo CDP. I don't like that, I think that you eventually, overwhelm the whole system? Yeah, it's like going forever without an oil change. Like eventually it's going to start smoking and burn itself out that it has its limitations, right? I think we have a data problem before we have.. We have a data cleanliness problem. What we get into that, right? Yeah. Again, are we getting all the data? Is it normal? Then can it be put through these kinds of engines and then what can do to deliver out? But it's something North Star, you'd love to have. Yeah, absolutely. Like a superchur in the car when the car is not running running well right now any anyway. Right. And we just. We're scrappy, and we're smart as a team. And I'm going to say this, but we. We don't have intelligence. Like, we' not we're not just dumbies. No, no. You know what I'm saying. It's like, there's intelligence. You can have a shitload of data if it's not malleable and it can't be predictive. We don't really understand who we're targeting. Like We have a cleanliness problem. We have a collection problem. Then we have an attribution problem, then we have a communication channels problem. 99 problems. We do have 99 problems. CDP is one as. But it's terrif challenging when we're like, hey, we got to get 12,000 new members in January, right? And you're just like, great. At $200, it cost Bar acquisition, like, let's go get them. And that's not feasible either. Because you you're writing a bike out of here. And so that's why this project I am really excited about because it'll finally allow us to level set on an ecosystem that's performance driven. We're not a We want performance, we're not a performance striven group. Yeah, and I think. I think part of it is for those that don't understand the concept of CDP and what it all does and brings, and they hear, you know, anecdotal, well, I'll be able to know that if this person, you know, touched this website or this, I can know that they have, you, a sister's brother's hairdresser that does that, you know, these connective things to get to where you want kind of the data enrichment aspect of it. And I feel like we need to put, like, some, like, tangible, live examples of potential customer, a touchpoint, whether it's a website or some other social media, whatever that gets them in to play, what am I able to do with that member? Realistically, with a CDP? What does it bring to the table to say, I go from an initial touchpoint of a potential customer to identifying the true value of how I make them, not a potential customer, but a real customer. I mean, and that's just the acquisition side. There's obviously once you are a member.. Engagement. There's all other sorts of engagement touch points that we have to, I guess. We've also architected this in a way because we've had to. It's like, you talk about budget leaks or profit leaks on this is, hey, is when you have if there is a lag time, so say there's a 24 to 40 hour lag time to where, if you get a membership and but you're not recognized in howons it has to transfer from Mososo to Hub, then hubspot to the media agency, there's a latency there of over 48 hours where you're still getting serves at. if not longer. And so that's a wasted impression and a waste cost that could go to some money. And also bad memory. Like, you don't even know I'm a member? Like.. Yeah, you go and work out twice in two days and then all of a sudden you're getting served. Like the wrong stuff. The wrong stuff. You're in the wrong journey. So are you ready promos to current members then to letend stuff? Are you trying to get upselves? We do. We do. It's not necessarily. It's's more internal. So's push notification, it's emails, and then it's in gym promo signage that you'd use a QR code for. And that's mostly around things like the retail shop or the CPTS program. So there's that all that creative come under you and you push it out? Yeah. Got you. Does RD Germany still have any involvement with asset creation and direction? No. direction comes from us. Great. Because for a while it was a just additional pain points, differences of opinions and cultures and all the things. There's a live previously that sounded like somebody who had an idea of what you should sound like in the U.S.'s,W to be cool American." Yeah. Levi's Chains and Coca Cola. just to be time conscious, Jake brilliant in presentation, as usual. Do you mind following up an email at least to myself, you had a list of those four issues or four problem areas? And then in the email also put in maybe some non negotiables like when you think of a unified system, right? And you've already called out, we're not performance true, and we are limited in our broad scale or a brain level, capabilities, right? And that kind of stuff. Give us some of your non neggotiables going forward and what the news tech stack, you know, for your department, would require. Great. kind of anything like that, because they not only hearing it within seeing that in writing and we're going to colllate everyone's non negotiables department by department, and then layered on top of, you know, the bubble map and the ecosystem and the other things. But I think that would be anything else that you felt like we ran out of time that you wanted to voice, but you couldn't today, you might going out an email? I don't mind, I don't That'd be perfect. just maybe by the of the week, is that possible? Maybe a little bit of time for that, that'd be perfect.. And appreciate you not saying it by the end of the day. No, no, no. By the end of the hour. When you leave here, directly send this email to me, because you're typing your phone. You're marketing, you don't have anything to do right now. You. Yeah, sure. So probably one of many conversations or touch points, not always in person, sometimes it might be just teams meetings for additional followups. But this is going to be a huge ongoing project with lots of involvement, lots of input from many, many people. Yeah, doesn't follow up, especially if I' l with, here's what we heard, you, from your department. Can you validate you, those kinds of things? Missing the work, not anything. go from there.. I'm surprised you had more than just this project on your big rocks for the. Well, it's one of those things, ITs, projects are heavily driven by what the business needs are. So when I looked up there, I'm like, okay, Robbie's got those projects, we're involved. Erin has some projects we're involved, you know, there'll probably have some working projects, digital projects were involved. So we try to say, this is truly an IT initiative, such as the network, you know, upgrades and replacements. There's heavily IT driven, like we're deciding whether reason Cisco Moroy or, you know, HPRubas and all that kind of stuff, whatever. Obviously, one system we've been tasked to kind of drive that because it is technology North Star focused. So really, you know, other than that, there's the 10 or 12 others that will be a part of based on the needs of the business. Cool. Yeah. Thank you. It's pleasure meeting you. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Enjoy your lunch. Hopefully it shimes out. for delivery.
