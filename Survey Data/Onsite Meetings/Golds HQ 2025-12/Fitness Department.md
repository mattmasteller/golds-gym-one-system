**GOLDS Fitness Department 2025-12-10**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Overview of Technology Stack for Group Fitness and Personal Training:**

Erin provided a comprehensive overview of the technology platforms used for group fitness and personal training operations, including Motion Vibe, Moso, Stripe, Motionify, Basecamp, Jotform, Club Connect, Les Mills, Highrocks, and exercise.com, detailing their integration, use cases, and pain points, with follow-up questions and clarifications from Teams Hub 2 and Alexander.

- - **Motion Vibe Integration and Usage:** Erin explained that Motion Vibe is the primary platform for group exercise operations, handling instructor counts, payroll, performance reports, and schedule publishing. In John Reed Clubs, Motion Vibe is also used for personal training transactions, with integration into Moso for session decrementing and permission checks. Motionify is used for Pickleball bookings, with Stripe as the payment processor for non-member transactions.
    - **Pickleball Booking and Payment Workflows:** Erin described two methods for Pickleball court reservations: members use Moso for service add-ons and Motion Vibe for booking, while non-members use a Motion Vibe-created website with Stripe for payments. The system checks membership permissions via Moso and limits bookings based on membership type. The team discussed the declining use of non-member bookings and the need to evaluate the continuation of this process.
    - **App and Web Interface Limitations:** Erin clarified that class bookings for group exercise are handled in the app, while PT bookings require in-gym booking via Moso, which is considered outdated. The team discussed the desire to enable PT session bookings in the app and the technical challenges of integrating web and app interfaces, especially for permission checks.
    - **Additional Platforms for Programming and Certification:** Erin outlined the use of Basecamp for distributing daily studio programming, Jotform for tracking coach certification progress and historical training data, Club Connect for managing instructor certifications and compliance, and exercise.com for fitness competition leaderboards. Highrocks and Les Mills platforms are used for specialized programming and certifications.
    - **Process and Data Management Challenges:** Erin and Teams Hub 2 discussed the complementary roles of Jotform and Club Connect, with Jotform used for tracking skill progress and registration, and Club Connect for storing final certifications and compliance. Erin noted the challenge of migrating historical data and the need to streamline systems without losing valuable records.
- **Current State and Future Needs for Personal Training Technology:**

Alexander and Teams Hub 2 discussed the use of Demotu for digital movement assessments and programming, the integration challenges with Embody, and the need to enable remote PT session booking and programming delivery, highlighting gaps in current workflows and future integration goals.

- - **Demotu for Movement Assessment and Programming:** Alexander described Demotu as an AI-driven platform for digital movement assessments and client programming, allowing for rapid, accurate movement analysis and program generation. The platform is currently used by trainers, with plans to expand client-facing features and integrate with other systems.
    - **Integration with Embody and Data Management:** Alexander explained efforts to integrate Embody's body composition assessments with Demotu, aiming to centralize client data and enable seamless tracking of assessments and progress. Technical challenges include matching client identifiers and ensuring frictionless data flow between platforms.
    - **Remote Booking and Workflow Improvements:** Alexander and Teams Hub 2 identified the inability for Gold's Gym PTs to book or alter sessions remotely as a major pain point, contrasting with John Reed's more advanced workflow. They agreed that enabling remote booking and programming delivery is a top priority for improving member and trainer experience.
    - **Potential for Location-Specific Programming:** The team discussed the idea of creating location-specific programming libraries in Demotu, allowing trainers to prescribe workouts tailored to the equipment available at each facility. This feature is not yet implemented but is seen as a valuable future enhancement.
- **Evaluation and Integration of Recovery and Wellness Technologies:**

Alexander, Erin, and Teams Hub 2 discussed the current state of recovery programming, the evaluation of new wellness technologies such as blood work and genetic testing, and the organizational process for reviewing and integrating these solutions, with a focus on their potential impact on PT services and member engagement.

- - **Current Recovery Programming:** Erin explained that recovery is incorporated into studio programming cycles and through classes like yoga and breath work, but there is no standalone recovery program or dedicated marketing for recovery services. Alexander confirmed that recovery is supplemented through existing programs but not individualized.
    - **Evaluation of New Wellness Technologies:** Alexander detailed the ongoing evaluation of two wellness technologies: Max Gen (genetic swab testing) and Inside Tracker (blood work), both under review for potential integration. The team discussed the use cases, expected benefits, and the need to coordinate with franchisees and other stakeholders.
    - **Organizational Review and Decision-Making Process:** Teams Hub 2 and Alexander discussed the reporting structure for evaluating new wellness solutions, the importance of involving marketing and IT early in the process, and the need for transparency and coordination across departments to avoid surprises and ensure alignment with broader organizational goals.
    - **Revenue and Engagement Considerations:** Alexander shared that the primary value of wellness technologies is seen as a retention and engagement tool for high-frequency PT clients, rather than a significant direct revenue stream, and that the focus is on enhancing the client journey and personalizing services.
- **Historical and Current Use of Digital Content and Documentation Platforms:**

Erin and Alexander described the use of Google Drive and Basecamp for programming documentation, the historical use and discontinuation of Gold's Gym digital content platforms, and the challenges of migrating and consolidating data across systems.

- - **Programming Documentation Practices:** Erin explained that Google Drive is used for creating and storing programming documents due to ease of access, while Basecamp is used for publishing and sharing with coaches. The team discussed the potential to consolidate documentation in Basecamp but noted the challenge of migrating large volumes of existing data.
    - **History of Digital Content Platforms:** Erin and Alexander recounted the development and eventual discontinuation of Gold's Gym digital content platforms such as Gold's Amp and Gold's Gym Anywhere, which provided video classes and adaptive content but were sunset after the pandemic and organizational changes.
- **Discovery and Roadmap Planning for Future Technology Solutions:**

Robert and Teams Hub 2 emphasized that the current use of platforms like Demotu is exploratory and not contractually committed, highlighting the ongoing discovery process and the need for further deep-dive discussions to inform future technology decisions.

- - **Exploratory Nature of Current Technology Use:** Robert clarified that platforms such as Demotu are being evaluated and are not yet contractually guaranteed, urging the team to keep this in mind during discussions and planning. Teams Hub 2 agreed, noting that the purpose of the meeting was to gather information for future roadmap considerations.
    - **Next Steps and Follow-Up Actions:** Teams Hub 2 indicated plans to follow up individually with Erin and Alexander for deeper dives into their respective areas, aiming to ensure that future technology solutions align with operational needs and organizational strategy.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Non-Member Pickleball Court Reservations Evaluation:** Evaluate whether to continue offering non-member pickleball court reservations via Stripe, considering current low transaction volume and associated fees. (Erin)
- **PT Booking Functionality in App:** Collaborate to explore and implement PT session booking functionality in the Motion Vibe app for Gold's Gym, similar to John Reed's current capabilities. (Alexander, Teams Hub 2)
- **Club Connect and Jotform Integration Review:** Assess the potential to streamline or integrate Jotform and Club Connect for coach certification tracking, considering historical data and current process needs. (Erin)
- **Recovery and Wellness Vendor Review:** Email details of the recovery and wellness vendors under consideration (Max Gen and Inside Tracker) and include Teams Hub 2 for visibility and potential input from IT and other stakeholders. (Alexander)
- **Club Group Programming Mix Data:** Ask Katie Scheffers for the mix of franchise clubs with and without group programming in the next session. (Teams Hub 2)
- **Club Connect URL Sharing:** Send the Club Connect URL to Teams Hub 2 in the chat for reference. (Erin)
- **Jotform Link Sharing:** Share the Jotform link with Teams Hub 2 for their reference. (Erin)
- **InBody and Demotu Integration Meeting:** Facilitate a meeting between InBody and Demotu technical contacts to discuss and resolve integration for seamless client data transfer, ensuring no manual process is required. (Alexander)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

Overhaul potentially of our tech stack, which could include our franchisees we're kind of calling as a one system right now, for a lack of a better name, you know, for the project itself. But the goal is to take a real good look at all of the technology pieces in our operational processes here in the corporate clubs, but then also survey and interview our franchisees and what they have found to be working really well for them with regards to technology, within their operations and where technology actually falls short, and then try to find the possibility of unification across the entire brand. I'm sure that you guys, if you've been with Golds long enough, you don't understand that we're really all on on disparate systems. We're on a moso, you know, a core system for member management. A lot of the franchisees are on ABC, but even beyond just the core system, the ancill early systems, you know, for CRM, like Lan Tap or, Hubspot, or the on the app, are they using Aral line, everyone's kind of got a mixed bag. So we've invited in Matt and Mike as consultants, both of which have multiple years within the industry and they can speak about it and briefly here in a moment. But they've kind of been there and done that through this kind of a process, and having them help us out here at least in the Discovery phase and then in the design phase within, I think, give us a higher probability of success in the execution phase when we do want to go make those decisions start to make the changes, bring in data and things of that nature. So as we go, department by department, you here through the corporate office, talking to leaders like yourself, it really is more for Matt and Mike to kind of ingest in here. You know, what you guys are working on, what technologies you currently have, you know, for your group, what are the pain points, right, for those technologies? Don't think of this as an audit as to how well you guys are doing your job. It has nothing to do with that. It's more of a discovery and revelation of, hey, here's where we continue to struggle with and without technology, you, for the greater success of golds and the programming, you, that you guys have in your specific areas. So, you know, be brutally honest and don't hold back as to what we have and what we don't have, so that they can capture really good notes. Point out the things that are what we would consider non negotiables, right? You have something that's working, you have to have it at least not necessarily as this particular SAS product, but whatever product we may have in the future has to do these things, right? It cannot, you know, for our success, be without it, otherwise, we're back to manual and things like nature. So with that being said, I'll turn it over for just a really quick introduction from Matt and Mike, and then Aaron and Alex, if you guys can introduce yourselves what you do, and then kind of lead into, you know, everything. I just kind of talked about there from your perspective. Good morning, guys. I'm Matt and I think he kind of gave a pre introduction there, but I've been working industry for about 25 years, working with lots of different brands, mostly in the back office, doing exactly what we're doing here, integrating systems, building systems from scratch, working on consumer experiences, across the board. So, yeah, just looking forward to hearing more about what you guys do specifically with golds, and especially like what he was talking about, the pain points. We really want to know where things are not working well and you're unhappy and, you know, if you had this or that, you would make your life much easier. And also things that are working well, too. You know, that you wouldn't want to lose in any kind of new tech stack or system that we're looking at. So great meeting you, and look forward to chatting more. Nice meeting you, too. We remind me of your name one more time. I'm sorry. Yeah, Matt, I think think the microphone's probably over here, yeah. Yeah, I. I heard that all the information, but I was like, I think I missed. Thank you, Matt. Can you guys hear me? Yeah. Okay, cool. Mike Hanson, I've been in history 25 plus years also. I would be more on the sort of operational side of the equation through multitude of brands, started back at 25 Fitness back in the day. And have also built brands in the space clubs for a new brand concept. I also have experience on the vendor side, so as part of the strategy executive team over at Mind Body in different groups. So I come at it from both angles, understanding what's possible in the software side, as well as some of the club side., mate. Cool. Alex, you want to tell us who you are, what you've been doing, what you're doing now? What have you? Yeah, no, absolutely. Well, first, Matt and Mike, great to meet you guys. I appreciate you here at us South today, and hopefully we can give you some great insight there. So, I'm Alex, senior director of Fitness currently, new to this role, I'd say about two months now. I'm still actually cood district managing the Central Texas, Oklahoma, Dallas Market, as I transition as being backfilt, so I've been doing that for the last few years Prior to that, I had launched the John Reed here in Dallas as the clubman there, and then I was a regional fitness manager prior to that. So been in the club setting, a lot of different ups and downs to. So I've kind of felt the technologies throughout the multi levels of it, so hopefully that'll be useful, but yeah, so apply new to this role, though. Perfect's Aaron. Hi, I'm Aaron and I have, um I can't roll, and it's really I've had for quite some time is I'm the director of group performance. Now that title has changed verbi wise, but pretty much I support all of our group. programgramming, operationally, and I help, you know, would we bring on a new program to make sure it's the right fit for our clubs and then help for the managers, like watch the programs within their jobs, how that looks today is much different than how it looked, maybe like 10 years ago. I like how you said back in the day with 24 hours. So there was a back in the day with Goldstri as well. We are definitely in a new day and a new time and a new place. So technology has really been an important factor in what we do because we run such a mean operations operationally in the clubs with, you know, one GM, one AGM, and then they have, you know, they support all the departments. So I do have a long list of, I guess, technology sites that I use for group exercise and I have my must have list as well. So I look forward to the advant to this and seeing probably the bestive work. Perfect. I'm gonna hit the record button that I was a little late on that. You guys will get a little notice on your side of teams that you have to agree to the recording. So let me click that off so I don't cut anybody mid sentence and then we'll continue. Wonderful. Okay. Um, Aaron since, since you've got your list and things kind of ready to go, why don't you don't you dive in and tell us about the technology stack that you work with daily basis, what the clubs are leveraging on the other side of group fitness and list them out, you know, give us the pain points and the best parts, things that you're missing, your wish list, you know, that kind of stuff. Okay, so the main platform we use for group exercise operation in our clubs is called Motion by. Motion by also is the app provider, so it's great that that system is not integrated. Motion by provides us with a system that's, you know, it's automated, so instructures enter their manual counts into the system. And then that's how we drive payroll. It's how we run all of our performance reports. It's how we basically publish schedules to the app and to the website. So it's our sorts of truth for all the group exercise operationally. In our genre Clubs, we use motion v for our PT side as well, so you can actually do transactions for personal training, Members can book their sessions online through mission vibbe. So it's a great engine that has integrated into other systems. Like we have integrated into Himosos to check permissions for people who are going classes, but it also provides with a you can actually like pay for services through their platform. We also use motion by for pickleball, which is its own like little Italy in one of our gems, so that is another integration we have which stripe. So I'm not sure if that's been brought up yet, but that's another one I have on your radar. All right, so that would be motion good? All right a quick question. So Stripe is the payment platform for any transactions that run through motion vibe? That runs for pickleball, specifically. Okay. Not just through motion vibes, so we use for John Reed, PT, they can process process the transaction and then that is all decrimitted into mos. So motion vibimosa are connected like to decerment sessions.. So if I'm a PT and somebody comes in to do their PT session, then I canor, I say like they showed up and then that gets decrimented out of Moso, but the engine behind that is motion vibe, the one that's doing the decor, I's telling Moo to decorment that makes sense? Absolutely. Okay. So if I'm y'all are technology people, so I probably hate this in a really weird way, so I've apologized. No, no, those are perfect indicators. So the pickleball, the pickleball reservations and for the cord and whatnot is a direct payment to stripe? It's its own system. It could be. There's two methods. So one method is people sign up for their pickleball membership. So they're paying a monthly fee to do pickleball so they could either reserve the court like four times per week or they could do unlimited blocks of time. And so there's two price points. If you're on the pick upwall membership, that's processed through Ramoso as a service, add-on, and then motion vibe is the engine that's like doing all the bookings. Like I booked the qu at this hour and this time and it knows that I have that on my membership through Moso. So it's checking the permission through Mosos for the person build books of courts. And it limits how much they have based on their membership type. We also have external members, so people who are not members, I should say external members, people who are not members yet, who can book the forts, and that's where the strike payment comes in because they don't we cannot use Moo as a transaction for nonmembers. It' it's a membership hub. Gotcha. That helps to clarify that. into that and really peel the layers. So there's got to be a so the court reservation on whatnot is still in Moo. Is that what I heard you say? Or the No, it's done in motion vibe, but Moso checks the permissions of the member to make sure that they have that membership on their accounts to be able to book the courts. Okay. For strike. It it's a stand up website, and so people can click on that website that most of I created that website and they can see where to book and then they process their payment. And we used to have like a kiosk in the gym. Actually, we do still have that kiosk where they can do it there or they do it from their phone, with a QR code. Okay, so even the nonmembers are leveraging the motion vibe interface to books. The nonmembers for the court, and motion vibe is leveraging stripe as their payment processor when it's not a member through Moso. Okay, I got it. Yes But we don't have as many of those because we had a partnership with somebody who was kind of helping us survive that nonmember traffic. So we don't really have that partnership anymore. He's kind of closed his storefront that was there connected to the club. And so we haven't seen it. I don't think we have a whole lot of those transactions happening right now, so that it's something to look at is this even something that we need to keep to being which just focus on member ads. And that's something that we probably need to make that choice soon. Because I know there's a fee based for the stripe. Yeah, that makes sense. And the motion vibe interface that's purely through the website, because I don't think we've got class bookings and PT bookings in the new app yet that we just launched. So is it all web interface? Yes, So if you you can book it through a website, and the website link is on the Rogers Ranch website, so you can put here for pickleable and then you can go to that link. Okay. Do I mean, and also then in in our corporate clubs, when it comes to PT scheduling and class scheduling, or class enrollment again, through motion vibe, it's more web based versus in the app. Is that right? No, so, well, for personal training, they have a member has to do their booking of a session at the gym. So we have to do that in Mosso. It's very. It's very dated. We would love to get it into motion by that. I think that would be a great thing for us to do because people could look at their sessions and the app and they could, you know, change their class times and all that stuff, like their session times in the app for a group exercise, we book all of our classes in the app. It's all in the app. I can't book on the website yet. I say yet because prior to us launching this new app, we had motionB was a website that would pull up in the app, so it was that native. Mm hmm. So it was the EM map, so we switched the motion via app, so I'm hoping that maybe we can somehow integrate to the website booking, but we're not there yet. Because then that also has to be able to check permission andosso. So there's that. There's that. Okay. All right. Well, we'll run that down later, maybe together. And members check in for classes, they book their classes, they reserve their classes, all in the app, and they can see the schedules on the websites. So that's all real time updated for our company clubs. Perfect. Okay. Did you guys get all that, then. It' pretty good? Yeah, sense. Okay, what else are you using beyond motion bybe? Okay, we use, um base camp, which is as a website that we use that for our studio programming, which we send to all of our coaches across the company. This is across the brand, so it's it's franchisees and company clubs. And this is a daily program that we provide them for Goldsfits and Goldsburn. And coaches can like communicate on the platform and can ask questions, we can answer their questions, but it's just basically a platform so we can easily see the workouts and share them across the brand. Base camp is a project management SAS platform right, so okay. And it's like $35 a month for unlimited use. So that we do like that part. Nice. Is that 35 per 35 per individual and he's to log in or just flat 35 for our 35 for everybody. Nice. Okay. Okay, good. Car on. So that's like everybody in the whole organization came out. Nice. Wait, I use Jot forms. Jot forms is how I store all historical data of trainings as well as I can track certification, their process of how they're being certified across the brand with our studio platforms. So like for studio coaches, like say the Alex is going to get studio certified, I track all of his progress in jot form. So he registers for the certification, I tracked his movement patterns, his coaching skills, all that's done in jotc. So we have a studio jot form account. And those two platforms I just talked about are specific two studio, like, Goldsfit and Goldsb. Okay, perfect, thank you. We also use high rocks that are now a new partnership for all of our programming for high rocks, but we log into their platform. I don't think that's like a huge, like, you know, I don't see us doing that any other way, but that's how we're accessing the high rocks. And we also do their certification that way. Okay, we utilizeercise.com for our leaderboards. This is for the GGFC, as well as for the gold ship competition, as well as for our studio in-house like competitions that we do, it's called March Medicon Madness. And so every week week we provide them with like a workout and they have to like track their scoress and then that's racked and stacked on this leader board in this website. What's the input from the actual members or participants in the fitness competition to the log indexercise.com and then log it or do they create us a unique ple within that or what is that kind of? All of the clubs, each club has their own unique login and that based on the gyms, like, I don't know call it, the W account, but like the gyms overarching accounts, like Anderson Arbor at Contact Us, you know, that the one that comes to whoever that manager is, because not specific to one person, but each gym has their own unique login and then we create these templates. So once they log in, they think, click on that template or that that basically, it's a website in the they add in the scores for each member. The member does use a QR code to register for reviews one time. Okay. Thanks. Okay. All right, we use Club Connect to track all of our certifications, current coaches, and for instructors, and this is across the whole RSG brand. That's how we have basically instructors of both theations and then we get checked to make sure that they are certified and they are up to their credentials. All right. We used Moso, obviously. Forgive me for for interrupting you. So Club Connect for your instructor certifications, but jot forms you said was for progress tracking in other instructor nodes. Do those complement each other? I mean, am I thinking of they're both similar and what you're using, but when does something specific that the other one doesn't do? Yes, the jot forms allows us to be able to send updates to coaches, because there's a certain skill requirement. They have to pass in order to become certified as a coach studio. For example, you have to be able to do kipping pull ups, you have to be able to do double unders. And these are harder skills, and sometimes it takes them longer than a three day certification, so I can track their progress on those specific moves, and then I can actually have like a timeline dated and then from there, I can say, yes, you once they complete all of them across the form, then I can submit that and then they get their certification, then their certification, they upload to Club Connect. So it's basically, it's it's a process tractor for us, and this is something that was created well before I supported it, but I haven't changed the process because there's so much historical data in there for all of ourcious that I really just we have to figure out how to move that if we're going to adjust that system. That makes sense. No, it's. So they're definitely connected. Do you feel like there's friction or opportunity between those two or you feel like you're doing the best you can, given what Club Connect doesn't do and what you need to do in the Jot Forms? Uh, exactly, what Club Connect doesn't do and what I need to do in the Jot forms. That's exactly right. Got it. Okay. So Jot form is the process to get the certification, and once they get the certification, it's in Club Connect. Correct, yes. And that's also how we can publish tradings. Google on a LinkIn register. So once the coach registers for that certification, I have their email, their name, their home club, and I can like basically create like a placeholder for them in the system so I can log in and see every coach that's registered and then from there, we enter their scores and it's like, it's just cheap all the data from me. And I can log into it and see it and so can the coaches who are facilitating the certifications. Is that just Club Connect.com or what's the URL That's the jot forms. Club Connect is, like, basically all certifications. So P's, group exerc instructors, that's for CPR, HR uses that, to make sure that somebody's credentials match that they're not, you know, they're not coming out of their certification window, So let's say that my CPR expired last month and I shouldn't be coaching, I should be put on, like, a hold until I can get my CPR renewed. And it just keeps us like liability wise in checks that we aren't sued for having people who are not certified coach, you know classes. I just was trying to know, is it just.clubconnect.com? Is that just the URO? Uh, no, it's a really long UR. Let me send you the URL, it's you right now on the chat. Thank you. And I think that was pretty much most of them. We also use Les Mills, which is very much like hrox. This may not be one that we can't change it, but the gems do have to log in to look at like certified instructors in the market. They can see basically, they can hire instructors that way and it's just like a way to connect the instructors to Les Mills and then vice versa, Les Mills are the instructors. How much of the Les Mills programming are reusing in our facilities or in nort their certification or even their virtual workouts? It's roughly about a 65% of our gold gym classes, and that's including studio R Les Mill based. So it's a significant amount. Can I ask you? Quick question. How many locations have group and how many don't? Like, what's the mix? All of them, but two have group. This is. So, Venice and.. Yeah, I. Bernet Road, do not have group, but all the other clubs have the potential to offer a group. And I say that because we have two gyms in Dallas. Of course. We're currently not really offering classes simply because they don't have the recruitment in place or they don't, you know, it's just not a pririty for them right now. So those their opportunity clubs. They have the space and they have the equipment to facilitate them. How does that work on the franchise side? It seemsems like they have less. We have clubs with them without. Sorry. You don't know what the mix is on franchisee by chance? I don't don't know. I do not know the mix. We can. I know that Katie Sheffers will know that, yeah. Yeah, we can ask Katie in the next session. We have her coming up right after you guys. Okay. Okay, I think that was that's all I had on my list so far. So, if anything else comes to mind, I'll let you know. But I did put the link for C Connect pair and the chat for you. Yep, I found it. And do you want me to add do you want me to add any links for the other platforms or are those pretty like, you already know those and you're good? The jotforms might be a nice one. I haven't seen that. I've seen base camera know what it does. And maybe someday, you and I will just get together and you can give me kind of a tour of everything that you do within motion vibe. I mean, I got a little bit from Nick, right? He gave me the right level. Obviously, I've been a part of the app rollout this last week and I've seen the app, and the app features and stuff, but what I haven't put into my brain yet is how deep you are, right, in the fitness and class programming because of motion vibe, and how it layers with Moso and how we're going to want to keep that with any, you core system of the future, you, as that in between where and what have you. So I'll just follow a look with you and maybe even after the holidays or something like that, where maybe you can just invite me to your world for a little while and get a good look at it. Absolutely. And I guess the easiest way to sum that up is how we are operationally supported in group exercise. It is the way that we are even able to operate under this structure because it creates this a very seamless way for us to do business and for us to have quick, easy access to performance of our classes. So I can imagine us not being able to access that arm, what we do for the groupex, so it's a a very much needed system for us Sounds like somewhere. Nonnegotiable. It is like, like my part's racing right now. just like, I was like, oh God, sweet jokes. Please don't disrupt this. No, there's no doubt in Nick. Nick has created you know, a compelling interface, right? You do substitute management in there, you do all your payroll reporting analytics, you know, all that kind of stuff because all the classes are in there. So to me, it's just, again, I want to go deep with you or that so that I understand the requirements so that when we go and we start to shop, right, we're not neglecting what you need. And or challenging, right, any coers system of the future to, hey, you guys need to connect in a very deep and profound way with motion by because they're not going anywhere, you know, that kind of a thing. So Yes, absolutely. I would happy to do that after holidays, Christmas will come a little late, yes. Wonderful. Anything else from? No, thanks, Aaron. That was great, great submarine and explanations of all the systems. Thank you. Alex, don't disappoint us, buddy. I mean,. Bef before we' jump in, quick question, Aaron. How is participation in the clubs like kind of walk me through the golds experience as it relates to programming? Because obviously I understand it on the weight floor and stuff of that nature, but not as familiar on the group side of the equation. So just curious how that compares to the industry and stuff from your perspective. I'm sure, so overall, like, if you want to look at our KPIs, we average 10 members per class, and that's within our studio clubs, which is like our bold state Goldsburn, which you have to pay an additional fee for to access those classes. And then we also have our free group exercise classes. So there's two, I guess, arms to that. On the free side, obviously, our aver is like runs around 12 to be honest, and then our studio averages around seven, but that is because the number of members who can access studio is smaller than obviously all members who can access freak through ice. So our usage penetration is sitting around a 7%? We do have clubs, halfalf bar clubs are actually are higher 10% or more, but we do have clubs like in our our smaller markets, Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma, that struggle with group fact exercise. So we we do know that the markets that have more density, more clubs tend to perform better. And I think that comes to several reasons. One, because members cross over into clubs. Two, we have more instructors to help support and cover asses and just build more energy. And I think that members also like having the variety of classes with several trips within like, you know, a 20 minute drive. So I think that those all kind of co hand in hand. And as you look at our portfolio, you can always tell that which f are remote and which clubs have like supporting jumps around them. I think that we have a lot of potential with group. I don't think it gets, like, dead or dying by any stretch. I just think that we have to, like, lean in a little bit more into what's trending, because I feel like that's, you know, no matter where I go, I'm going to see a new, you know, boutique studio coming up on the corner and it's packed all the time. So I know if people see these opportunities, but what they're doing really well is they're giving people an experience. So I think that the more as they bring we lean into the experience, like we've leaned into the weight training experience, I think we need to also look into ledient to the group experience. Sp get more personalized, make it, you, basically co to the younger demographic as well and just, yeah, elevate the experience. I think that helps. Oh, Sounds good. Is that does that answer your question? I, yeah, yeah, for sure. I just wanted to hear you talk about the experience, so. Okay, yeah. I mean, with our less most programming and it's great quality insurance, we have great programming, so, you know, it's just keeping the energy going and marketing that's fast as what we really need to do. And from what I see, you guys aren't carrying any of the Les Mills digital, right? That's not in the app. We have it in one club. We have it in one club, not digitally, not Les Mills digital. We have Lesville on Zimand at our. Fitness Hoppers co location. So members who go within onto the platform and so we have more classes at that club because we opened up kids club in that location. We have to say that wasn't really a great viable, like, I guess test for that particular product. We don't have very many kids to the kids club and we also don't have very many members utilizing the gym. So we haven't really won members back that way. However, you know, when you look at the schedule, it's very robust with having on demand classes, so I can offer buy pump, I get 5:30 a.m., when I may not have an instructor, and then you do to utilize it whenever they don't have an instructor and they are remote club so it has come in handy for them. Yeah. In, no group programming outside the club. You guys aren't doing anything outdoor, pop up, is? Yeah, well, yes, we do. in like, it's really small areas like, I guess, a small amount. So our corporate sales team, our corporate wellness team, will ask us like, hey, I have a hospital that wants to offer, you know, yoga and stretch for this many people at this state and time. And then we go out to their club and provide that service. And that's kind of like a manual process for us right now, simply because it's newer. We just sort of got that team back and we don't have very many of them. Okay. Cool. But that would be Eric Unkin, not to be confused with, I know I'm Aaron, too, but she's the other Aaron. We, like, have lots of similar same names in our company. It makes everybody stay on their toes that way. But she needs that scene, yeah. So she'll be upset and walk through that process. with her later.. Perfect. Okay, Alex. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of Alex is in the company, too, so, uh.. A couple of caveats I wanted to go on some of the things she talked about, and I didn't want to interrupt her. Club Connect to add on to that. It does the certification port she starts. It is also an education tool that we. It does continue to education for all of our PTs and groups if they'd like to keep their certifications valid at no cost to them. And also allows us to build internal company trainings that we launchunched through there, right? So we have our PT on boarding that does through there. I'm currently building a new course in there right now so it does serve that function as well. So it is a pretty good tool there. To piggyback what she was talking about motion time, kind of an ask, I would say, like, it's something we need, is what she was referring to the way that John Reed can book sessions for clients and purchase PT? We cannot do that for Gold's gym currently, so if I'm a PT, I am not able to book sessions or alter sessions unless I'm in the gym, because you have to be on our network cash and access motion soft. So if a client texts a PT tonight, they cannot change it till they get to the gym tomorrow, whereas if they had the motion by access, they'd be able to set. When I was at John Reed, that was a great function that allowed us to schedule and purchase a lot more effectively.. Yeah, I noticed that as we launched the app this last week that PT was not covered in the bookings and but the class scheduling was there, and it really shocked me and surprised me. But what I looked back at the Egyym, I don't know that it was sufficiently supported in our old app either, so that's an area where I think you and I should stay connected because Ryan and I are putting together a very short list of must halves as our next phase within the app. And if motion vibe obviously can support the bookings, the purchasing and the deckermenting as it needs to be, what have you, then that workflow, I think, needs to be engineers sooner rather than later on your behalf in your team's behalf. Yes, that right there, we could aomplish just that. This has made this entire endeavor worth it in my book. That makes it seamless for the members. It makes it very easy for the PTs, and it just creates a better experience across the board that it leads to better revenue streams. So that is a number. We're way for not having it, to be honest. Yes, you're absolutely right. I mean, we've been doing it at John Reese since 2021. Um Okay. So that's the person who just want to add on to, what's you saying there. So, as far as other technologies we use, Rick and I know you and I spent a fair amount of time talking about Tamal to the other week. That's a big one. That one currently has done utilized for two different processes for providing digital movement ass assessments for clients using AI technology, and then also for doing programming, right? This is where all of our programming for clients now lives. We do not do manual card programming. that will expand what we're currently in the process of trying to add pull in embody, which we'll talk about in a moment to where this will be a client's hub, essentially. We're all client information will live between their assessments composition assessments, and programming and potentially Park Hughes as well, to remove the need for manual filing cabinets in the future, like we're still operating. Like it's 2005. That's that's a pretty big endeavor for us right now. Demu is fairly new. So we're one of their bigger fish right now as we've partnered with them. But the co founders are very great if you guys want to speak with them, they always make themselves available.. How do you spell it? Dotu is DEM O T U. Is that right, Alex? Bullet. DMOTU. So explain to these guys just the attraction of Demotu beyond the programming and stuff, but highlight for them, you know, the movement screening and some of the other tools that your leveraging as that kind of funnel into PT and then talk about how you guys are leveraging, the programming on the back side and what you see as the future with that. Yeah, yeah, and so, as I dive into, one thing you'll see when you look them up, you're gonna see like client interface stuff, and it doesn't necessarily reflect how we utilize it the same way, because as an individual, I could probably go download the app, I can go download the app right now and use this technology outside. So we use it a little differently on our end. So the first part with the digital movement assessment, it's very simplified while giving a great amount of information. So in the past, it would take a PT, a lot of education and experience to be able to do a movement assessment and target, you know, this is where your compensations are. These are your retired tight parts, these are the issues you're in experience. Am I to use the AI's where you just do one movement instead of multiple repetitions to a lot that it captures all that pretty accurately, and you can play back the video, you review it, and then it gives you key bullet points to discuss with the client, and then it makes recommendations on how to fix the compensations. It finds, where in the past that would take you, a PT, a fair amount of research after the fact to kind of understand if it's not something' counted before. So it does a really great job there. And it also gives visual references that you can then share with the clients, say, look, these are your red parts, these is your movement qualities. So it's a great sales tool as well, realistically. I found it to be very useful. Then it also tracks us, you can see, historical imp movement patterns and you can go back each time and it will show you where your improvements are, where your lack of improvements are. And if you're creating other issues, and then it may other recommendations on how to follow those through. So that's the movement portion. It really simplifies and condenses the process to what in the past to get good quality assessment can take 10 to 20 minutes. You can now do it in three to five minutes. So it also just expedites and creates a better experience in my opinion. Then on the programming side, it's great there because it allows you to you can implement all your programming very easily, and you can view it from anywhere. You can share it with clients. We have not unlocked that function for the PTC yet as we want to make sure we've worked any bugs out, but in the future, they will be able to send these directly to clients if they like to. It also provides video references if you're selecting exercise that maybe you're not familiar with, and then it's got an AI function there as well, that you can do one of two things. If I want to take the block I currently build or like if I build it one week or two week or even five week program, I could use the AI function to continue that program and a professs a progressive format. So it creates ease of programming, but it also will kind of take you in you can put it into a form that maybe it's not how I traditionally program it. It's kind of teaching as well. So it's a really cool process there. For PTs that are less experienced, you can generate a program from scratch without putting any input other than your props. I mean, obviously, I imagine you all are familiar with, like Chat GPT and all the AI functions that are out there, the more intricate your proms are, the more precise it gets to your request. But if I put in there 25 year old male wants to work in strength training capacity with a split routine three times a week, it will build me a program based on those all the way through. So it's pretty cool there. It streamlines some of the programming. Just like any AI process, I wouldn't recommend trying to write an essay with CGPT without proofreading it and making corrections, and it's the same, right? You may have to maneuver some of the programming to perfectly facilitate your training modality, but it's been pretty impressive so far, keeping in mind, we've only been using for about four months now, and we're still evolving in every day. So I know that was a word bom, so I'll take a pause for a second and see you guys, any other questions on kamatsu? exercise in Video Library is that self contained, or can you create and add to that library, you know, from within our facilities? We've currently been adding, and so yes, we can continue to add to it. We had to do that, especially as we have a large subset of gyms now that use like G equipment, which wasn't currently available in Mu, because obviously that's pretty unique to our brand and the U.Sways currently. Wonderful. And this is just me geeking out a little bit. Do you see, you see yourself creating that programming library? to be location specific? So if I am a client, you know, at, you know, location A and you've already cataloged all the equipment in that facility. Do you see your trainers leveraging perhaps the library and programming or demotu recognizing that this programming is for this location, this location only has these 30 machines in, you know, workout bays. Do you feel like Demotu has that potential, or would you want to be location specific in your programming? We haven't actually currently discussed. That's the first time I've even thought of that with you mentioning it here. I would imagine that is a functional capability, but it's not one we've discussed. So I't I don't. I want to take the credit for it. I mean, someone else came up with the idea. It's recorded. We've got it recorded. Yeah, but I like the idea. You know, in one of our franchisees, actually, you know, came up with the idea in how their putting together some of their technology, you, around the similar things. But is if you're going to prescribe to me a workout when I'm not with you as the personal trainer, and I'm likely to come to this facility more often, wouldn't it be cool if it literally walked me around the gym to these locations versus just saying, here's the exercise. Now I have to go and find the equipment that matches that particular movement, whether it's, you know, elbow extension or the extension or what have you, you know, kind of a thing. So again, kind of geeking out a little bit, you and I can spend some time on that later on, Alex, for that, but was just kind of curious. What are some of the other So Demotu obviously is a BDC product if we were to go out and find it ourselves. You are using it as a B to B platform for your personal trainers, where will eventually become a B to B to C in this prescriptive kind of approach or interaction. What are some of the other B to B tools that you're leveraging within demot 2 and or that it doesn't have that you are curious as to whether it's have, and I only lead that conversation for you to give us more of an as is, because you and I talked last time a little bit about the potential roadmap with them. and one of the things I remember coming out of that conversation is really you and I and Aaron probably need to get together and be sure that motion vibe isn't already potentially doing some of the things that you're thinking you may want so that we don't get an overlap or a redundancy and we can find a way to get demotu and motion vibe in the app, all to be free to well unified in the flow that we're expecting from B to B, but also B to B to C. So I know that was my own word salad there. Give us a little bit of that perspective that you have, and then we'll do a deeper dive of some other time. Two apps right now? Shoot.ote two. Well, as Alex declared there, they're not yet inviting the members into Dotu, it's an in club, personal training tool to which they're interacting with on the personal, but right now, if I'm right, Alex, members are not seeing any demote to interface but we would have to bring that into the app at some time we wanted to. Is demo to being utilized in front of the paywall? Meaning it's just when you become a member, when you do that analysis as part of your sort of like on floor hours to convert to be Yeah, the way it works firmly is only at the gym employees have access, and it's just like embody per se. When you meet to meet with me face to face, I do the process, I show you on the screen what's happening, but you do not see that after that interaction unless we facilitate other interactions whether it's another follow up or a session. So that point, something that Rick and I had discussed a little bit would be, you know, those assessments being viewable on, say, the app, as we hopefully look to make recommended, you can purchase, you know, workout programming if you decide not to be a one on one client, this can't generate that, but we have a fair way to give it to the client that doesn't require them to have something autonomous removed from us. Like, I don't want them to downloading dem mods and doing this on their own. We're going to a trainer rise or something like that. What's your capture rate for PT business? do you? What' two or tot? Just in total, what percentage of members are buying PT services? Just curious where that's at? So, we'll start with new members, because it's shifting on average, we get around 7 between 7 and 10% of new business per month engage depending, around 5% of that comes new comp sessions, about two to 3%, depending on the month it comes from a point of sale, that's engagement prior to, you doing the Dematsu and embody, and then the rest of it is just some pickup off the floor, followups and things like that. So, between seven and 10%, we're striving to maintain 10%, but we we're not there yet. And that's new members, right? That's not total members. We because we've shifted our business over the last few years, it would be crazy for me to give you an accurate number there. Okay. Sorry. And then, just I'm jumping out of order here. Where's recovery? Is that sitting under you? If there's any programming, or you guys touching that at all, or just a service that sits on the floor? When you say recovery, what do you mean?, you could go cold plunk on it, you could go tons of different bout hacking different options. Some clubs are doing it, obviously in the franchise east side of it where you guys are around on the corporate side? Well, I mean, are Burnett Road location has some recovery devices, you know, that's equip. It's your membership, you scan your barcode and it knows whether you have access to the machines or not, but I don't know if it's an instructed.. There's no programming? I don't believe there's any programming. It's not programmed. We do have recovery program builts into like our studio programs. Like it's part of the mesoccycles that we're usually utilizing. And we do have, you know, yoga classes, we have breath breath work, you know, those things are there, but we haven't like labeled it and like put it into a pocket of recovery, so to speak, like mini brains are doing, we don't, you know, I've seen what like equinoxygen on, like, we're not doing any kind of blood work or any, anything in that space, but we do have recovery built into our programming every sequel cycle. So we do take our members through that. So, to your point. But it's not marketed, yeah. Yeah, we don't really actually have a cover as you look at it as what other brands would consider recovery. It is it's supplemented through other sources, right? If you're doing PT, if you're doing studio, you would get some recovery in there, but it's not individualized. Now, I will say, we are currently working with two brands that we're presenting up. One is going to be the biomarkers to blood work, and the other one is a newer one that is a mouse swap that gives you like, when you do the mouth swap, it it'll tell you what's your optimal rest is, you know, where your calories are most utilized best, right? Things like that. None of those are implemented yet, as we're currently going to review stage of those, and I'll be making a final recommendation this month. We'll probably go with one and the other, not both, so it'll lead to be Blood Worker's Swaff, which each have their own benefits, but we are not live with either of those yet. Alex, will you send me, you, those particular companies that you guys are reviewing? You, through that and maybe just bring me along or read me in on our next conversation. The only reason I ask that is because some of the franchisees have begun to identify, you, their trusted partners or potential partners in that, and even Mike, you, has a network of businesses that are very similar that he brought to my intention prior to and into all of this. And I just want to make sure that want to be able to read them in on who you're looking at and the pluses and minuses around that. When it comes to making the decision on those kinds of things, in our organization, who would you be reporting to that, you know, fitness is going to be bringing in something like blood work or what we'll call wellness or longevity, you know, kind of science and testing. Who do you report up to with those decisions? When do we get marketing involved? When does technology brought in, right, for the evaluation, for potential inclusion, what have you? So maybe you can maybe just write me up, you know something that kind of tells me where you are and who you're talking to and how you see that going, just so I as we talk about the bigger ecosystem, we can just be across you know what you're doing and not be surprised in a month that you've picked something specific and you, whatever. We're not here to change your mind or interview interview interrupt the process so much as the sooner you bring me in at least for exposure across the board, the sooner than I can be helpful through the IT department at least, and exposure to to these guys, as to the big picture. Yeah. Now, we love surprise right now. I'll definitely try to avid it though. It is the gold way. That's right. It's kind of Jen, which does the swabs, and then I have inside tracker, which does the blood work. Those are the two currently reviewing. And this was at the behest of the German team. They had asked for us to review these and making a recommendation. which Max, we did a small partnership with the GGFC. We provided those swabs to the competitors there I'm waiting at you for their feedback. I want to see how they used it, how they felt about it, so are you are you open to any others as far as their happy and tossing the ring if Mike and I were to come up with one or two names that weve been sneaking a peek at, or do you want to keep it where you ought to have us? I mean, they have something more unique that is different from these two products, you mind that you're both wildly different products. One is the blood work for blood paneling, and the other one is genetic coding, essentially, that tells you what you're doing with special sponsors. There are definitely too different products. But if you guys have recommendations that operate outside of what these are, if it's just the competitor with them, I mean, I would say I indiff difference in getting feedback on it, just becauseause, I mean, if they're just the same thing, but a different name, I don't really honest with you. Well, just email me what you have and we'll make we'll discern whether it's worth your time. I don't.. No, I'm I've always hoped that there's a better product for sure. Alex, we can offline on it. I know all the inside tracker data has it relates to performance. Like, I don't know if you know Fitness SF, they probably piloted it, so I know what the take rates are and all that type of stuff specifically on it. I guess my question is, are you looking at it as a single point solution for revenue, or are you using it to drive PT services, right? 'Cause it's very different. Yeah, so as I looked at this, I don't see these being a good point of remedy for us as a business, I don't see the margins being there enough for us. You'd have to get way too much engagement. I think it is to capture kind of a minority set of PT clients that maybe we're not currently capturing, and maybe a retention tool for kind of your more frequent clients, if you will, with a little more affluent background, right? Like if you're training once a week, is this going to be the most, your blood going to be the most influential thing? Is that cost versus return going to be worth it? I don't know. But those that are serious about training coming in four or five times a week with a trainer, training for a, I think those are clients that this would be a great, like asset too. That's kind of as I vision. I could be wrong, I'm definitely open to feedback there. Yeah, no I met with Cam with the franchise in Tampa, and she thinks it's a great fit specifically for her clientele. I know the walls and that type of stuff, they're actively working on a project, but I think a lot of it comes down to most people aren't looking at just the tests, they're looking at, how do I take that information and personalize it into a journey, which is the kicker, because most of the testing's testing, right? That's actually AI. They consulted in. We can talk about it later. I'm just curious where your head was at and where this was falling, because I'm like looking at the broader picture really understand what the g of the future looks like a little bit. That's why I asked the question. Yeah, no, it's a great question.. Okay, so. Yeah, yeah. So there's technology. The other one, embody, right? That's a software and hardware that we launched this year throughout the brand. The only part of our brand is not utilizing it is going to be Oklahoma. It was just a cause for traffic. It just didn't make sense in Oklahoma market currently, so they're the only ones that do not have it. I think we're all pretty familiar with embody at this point. as far as how that works. Currently, we have the master account that allows me to view who's utilizing it and what that is. We're not doing anything with that technology, effectively yet, because I'll be honest, embodies Web service kind of is not amazing if reviewability and trackability. So that's where we are working to partner with pulling them in and combining embody or integrating embody into Datsu to where if I have Mrs. Jones over here did digital movement assessment, it will now pull embody in and assign that composition assessment to that client's portfolio or portfol as well. I thought there were there wasn't a unique identifier easy enough in inbody when you did the data extraction to do that. You don't have a connection there, do you? Not current. So what I'm told by inbody, in this, I have a call Thursday with both of them. They're telling me they have integrated. Embody told me they have integrated. What evident Deontu's telling me is, no matter what identifier they have, because currently they use phone numbers in embody that we're seeing. He' said, no matter what identifying they're using, he said that they can extract it a mirror to link these profiles up. I'm not a tech guy, so I don't understand how that works. So I've got the two technology folks getting on a call on Thursday to where I basically just there. It's historically been a problem with inbody, like, everybody has embody, but historically it's been a problem. So just make sure that you don't have a manual process in between there. Just make sure they say, hey, I don't want a manual process. Yeah, if you need help those conversations, by all means bring me in and you know, my sass and product experience probably could help you, you know, really articulate. You want something that's so friction free that if you put somebody into motu, we'd already calls in body and sets up the account and inbody's waiting for you, or the vice versa, right? You you don't want to necessarily have to put them in both. So if you need any help at all by all means, ring my bell, and I'll be happy to come on and, you, help you have that conversation with them. No, I appreciate that. I'm hoping to see this. I mean, when I talk with Evan, he speaks to Lingo like, you guys do, so I only understand about 10% of what he's telling me. But he says the open AI, he's researched it, he says this should not be a problem, so this is our initial conversation. If I don't feel like we're making headway on Thursday, we'll definitely look to do that, because, yeah, this is really a critical function for us.Cause right now, I can't see historical data. I can see it, but it's not digestible currently in the embody's website to say, these are our trends who's using it, which clients are using it. Are they comp non clients, are they actual clients? What progress results are they seeing? I can't currently compile all eggs too much. Got it. And that's what demotes is supposed to help me there. Okay. So in that's for that? Embody is kind of a legacy system going away and Dotu is going to be the platform you want to use going forward. But inbody isn't there's a set of assessment tools, that will get pulled into Doto.. Right. Yeah.body won't go away. They just not offering up enough B to B tools, right? They're not tool rich in the ability for.. movement analysis brainers. Gotcha.. So one of us continue use their hardware, which is great. When I stand on that machine and it tells me what's going on, we will use that, but we're going to use the mu to house it and potentially analyze it for us too. So we're looking at it as well.. Which is kind of next step next phase, that if we can get it to integrate the embody assessments in there, can his powerful, powerful book quotations? AI, then analyze that so PTs don't have to try to analyze it on the spot organically. Gotcha. Makes sense. Great. Well, what else are you guys use? I think that's the big ones right now. Let me make sure I So Datu, uh, Embody, obviously Moo, Motion vibe. On the fitness side of the cliping, those are the ones that we are generally using right now. I'm trying to think if I'm missing any. I do use Google, like share drives for our programmers, for Goldsfit. I forgot to mention that one. That could be moved to another, like hub, but we just find that to be super easy for logging in and then also for people, you know, shared doc. We did try to use One drive, but the issue was that some of our programmers, are utilizing their gold G email because they're coaches and they're not PT, so they don't they're having trouble like walking into their gold G email and then they have to reset their passwords so that they can't get into the platform. So I'm sure Ricky you've heard that many times, but we switchitched back to using the Google docs so they can easily access it from anywhere. And that's in it. That's an additional programming documentation beyond what your leveraging base camp for? Correct, yes, 'Cause Base Camp dem republish it, but it's created in Google because that way we can then copy and paste it into Base camp. We could create in Base camp. I mean, we could switch to that. We just haven't because we have so much data. So again, it's like, we have so much like storage and like our docks are already in there. They're already created. It's just, it's easier just to keep capitalizing that system.. But if we need to move it over, we can, if we're trying to like streamline. So Does gold have any history of digital? Has there been any videos online, even during the pandemic or like, is that a thing? Let's talk about it? We did up in the past. We had.. Oh, I, if you'd like.. We also had Gold G anywhere, because we had videos, we actually had video classes we were creating to where it was be part of the app, so we could take basically gold Jim anywhere you wanted to go. And I got sunset? It was sunset. You may know Adam. He was our former CEO. Yeah. So he really spearheaded that we actually created all the conent with a, like actually like a production team in Dallas and they did all these videos and it was a very highly organized and it was very detailed, so it was a process where it even had people with who needed adaptions, like they were in wheelchairs or they were, you know, amutees. They had content for those superls wrong. Yeah, the gold's amp and the gold's anywhere, I think, died in the pandemic, you know, basically, and it was right after I left in 19 due to go to Hana, and then they don't think it' survived too much longer. Yeah, because now it's on your television. Right. Yeah, we were using Antelli, so did it Survived Dark Tuesday? Right. We need to switch rooms. We're at a time for the both of you. Thank you so much. We've got a ton of information. Before we do Rick, I'm sorry, our last meeting went long. Was there anything that we need additional clarification on Aaron Alex, Rick, that I can support right before we go. No, I think both of them did a great job of outlining, you, the technology that's currently in use and, you know, a few of the pain points around there and even the vision towards I think the deeper dive of conversations really are more to how to exploit and further, you, what both of them have already done. They did a great job, presenting.. So I just, you, we just want to make sure that, you know, we recognize that the things they are doing in the systems they are using are exploratory right now, they are not contractual, they are not guaranteed. I just want to circle back on that conversation to make sure that we're on the same page that we're still in the discovery and building process of these. I say that's specifically to demotu, because in many meetings, this is becoming a topic of conversation, because it's an exciting topic until we have assigned agreement and we are a guaranteed provider of that, we just have to keep that in mind. Yeah, I understood, Istood. Hey, look, we're here just for Discovery to feel, you know, what's kind of going on so we can keep it on the roadm, you know, for possibilities down the road. So appreciate that. Thank you both. I'm sure I'll follow up with both of you individually and an Alex, because there's a lot more than I want to learn, you, with the new department and the success that you're having there. So I appreciate you both. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Thank you guys, guys. See you. Bye- bye. Bye. All right, so we got to go back to the other room to get with the franchising group. Sorry for the uh. No, we're switching to the big one? Yeah. They kick us out of their in order to have a bigger meeting.
