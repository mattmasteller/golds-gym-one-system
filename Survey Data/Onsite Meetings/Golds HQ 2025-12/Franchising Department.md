**GOLDS Franchising Department 2025-12-10**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Brand Positioning and Strategic Focus:**

Teams Hub 1 led a discussion with the group on Gold's Gym's renewed focus on strength and performance training, emphasizing a shift away from being an all-purpose gym and outlining the implications for member experience, programming, and competitive positioning.

- - **Historical Brand Evolution:** Teams Hub 1 explained that Gold's Gym initially focused on strength training but shifted to a broader 'everything for everyone' approach in the 2000s, which diluted the brand and increased competition with other gyms offering group exercise and boutique experiences.
    - **Return to Strength and Performance:** Following the RSG acquisition, the leadership decided to realign the brand with its heritage by prioritizing strength and performance training, moving away from standard group exercise and aiming to build the ultimate strength and functional training gym.
    - **Member Experience and Onboarding:** The team discussed the need to clearly define and enhance the member journey, including onboarding processes, programming for all experience levels, and storytelling to communicate the benefits of strength training to a broad audience.
    - **Competitive Differentiation:** Teams Hub 1 highlighted that Gold's Gym's unique position as a strength-focused brand should be leveraged to attract members from competitors, rather than attempting to compete directly in group exercise or boutique offerings.
- **Product and Membership Model Development:**

The group, including Teams Hub 1 and other participants, explored the design of the core product and business model for new and existing franchises, focusing on amenities, pricing strategies, and the integration of recovery and performance services.

- - **Amenity and Service Bundling:** Participants debated whether to include amenities like recovery services and performance training as standard in memberships or to offer them as premium add-ons, referencing examples from other gyms and the impact on perceived value and usage.
    - **Pricing Flexibility and Market Adaptation:** The team considered the need for flexible pricing structures to accommodate different markets, such as offering bolt-on options for lower-priced memberships while maintaining a premium core offering in company-owned locations.
    - **Turnkey Franchise Offering:** There was consensus on the importance of providing new franchisees with a clear, turnkey package-including facility design, equipment, programming, and technology-while allowing for some local pricing autonomy.
    - **Retrofit for Existing Franchisees:** The group acknowledged the challenge of migrating legacy franchisees to the new model, including the need for data mapping, change management, and standardization of offerings and reporting structures.
- **Digital Transformation and Technology Stack:**

Teams Hub 1 and the group discussed the critical role of a unified digital ecosystem-including fitness programming, member management, and global reciprocity-in supporting the brand's strategy and franchise growth.

- - **Digital-First Member Experience:** The team emphasized the need to deliver strength and performance programming digitally to all members, not just those engaged in personal training, and to provide location-specific content and community features to increase engagement and retention.
    - **Tech Stack Requirements and Integration:** Participants identified the need for a robust, scalable technology stack that includes CRM, lead follow-up, and integration with third-party platforms, with a preference for partners willing to innovate and adapt to Gold's Gym's evolving needs.
    - **Global Reciprocity and Data Management:** The group explored solutions for enabling seamless member access across domestic and international locations, proposing a centralized travel pass platform that tracks visits and verifies membership status without requiring deep integration with every local POS system.
    - **Automation and Support Infrastructure:** There was discussion about automating as much of the franchise onboarding and management process as possible, while recognizing the need for internal support teams to handle configuration, troubleshooting, and ongoing vendor relationships.
- **Franchise Operations and Support Model:**

The meeting addressed the operational implications of the new franchise model, including support responsibilities, revenue streams, and the balance between central control and franchisee autonomy.

- - **Centralized Support and Staffing:** Teams Hub 1 raised concerns about the increased support burden on the franchisor as more responsibilities shift in-house, including technical support, customer care, and configuration, and questioned whether current staffing levels are adequate.
    - **Revenue Streams from Technology:** The group discussed potential new revenue streams for the franchisor, such as transaction fees, rebates from billing vendors, and service charges, drawing comparisons to models used by other fitness franchises.
    - **Standardization Versus Autonomy:** Participants debated the appropriate level of autonomy for franchisees in configuring offerings and pricing, aiming to balance brand consistency with local market flexibility and operational efficiency.
- **Next Steps and Action Items:**

The group concluded by identifying the need for further internal alignment on the product and business model, continued evaluation of technology partners, and ongoing discussions to address outstanding gaps and finalize the franchise offering.

- - **Internal Alignment Meetings:** The team agreed to hold follow-up meetings among key stakeholders, including Danny, Brad, and others, to clarify the turnkey product, business model, and responsibilities for both new and existing franchisees.
    - **Vendor Evaluation and Integration:** Participants planned to continue evaluating technology vendors such as Demo 2 and Les Mills, considering both immediate and long-term integration needs for digital programming and app development.
    - **Ongoing Communication and Support:** The group committed to maintaining open communication channels with franchisees and support teams, scheduling additional sessions and site visits to ensure alignment and address any emerging issues.

**Transcript (voice memo)**

because of the obviously is a huge, huge project and in the time interconnected it is the company franchise new and lock up. We'll do this. You go ahead I'll track no easier. Good timing have lots of coffee. Yeah, yeah., go ahead and kick off kind of a quick intro on. Sure, yeah, yourself and you guys. My name is Matt. Matt in vitually, but I bet in the industry 25 years worked for several different brands throughout the years. Mostly in the back office, I've built membership management systems, integrated systems across the board and again, working for a lot of multi unit franchisee franchise oars. And yeah, just looking forward to learning more about the processes you have, the tools you use, and especially with the franchise, what you're going to be selling you know, the next few years what the gym looks like. The gym with the future. Yeah. What franchise organizations have you worked with? Cunch, fitness world. It's a Canadian club. and other, you know, other, like, what's that? UFC? UFC G. Yeah.. Yeah, what they're doing for us is similar to what you guys have already done and been a part of for the UFC, right? Taking that kind of from a a disparate franchising situation to a common platform. Yep, yep. this is a franchise meeting. Yes, just lock in. Mike Hanson been a ministry 25 plus or something, 98, so since7. Multiple clubs, so club operations won'side, and then also the M clubs for brands. So for North Gle partners to the investment in Brooklyn Bald there's also on the software side, so far the strategy of the you' takes the mind body and different software systems. So I come at it from both sides, so it happens out on the software side and on the both side. You know, and for context, Mike and I work together when I was with Nana on a few different projects, I call serial entrepreneur within the space, at the fractional CTO and experience, you know, on the site as we go lean in on right the one system, you, unification and overall. These guys have been there and done that, right? So experts in the space, along with, you wisdom and experience doing what we're about to do, it was almost a no brainer to introduce them to the team and see if they can't help guide us along. We'll Ryan and I's job along with the team here is is about execution, but these guys are here to really kind of mentor us and be sure that we're going in the right direction and this base zero that we're in right now is pure discovery, it's not necessarily audit. Are we doing good or not doing good? It really is about us departmentally. showing them and talking about what is working, what are we using today within technology? What are operations, and what's our dream? What are the pain points that are holding us back, from where we want to be as a brand, or are within your department, you know specifically in a successes? So don't hold back on what it is that, you know, is good or bad. You know, you just put it all out there, right, because the discovery process enables them to show us a path of design and architecture for the to be of the future, right? Which is technology supporting, franchising, supporting, you, brand health and wellness and growth, you across the board. So they're going to ask some probate questions, but the reality is, you guys really need to talk. openly, you, about where we are and what we want to do so that they can come back and the next adjustments after this, with the audit phase, if you will, or sorry the scurry phase, we will be putting that survey together to the franchisees. The survey hasn't gone out because we felt like a lot of what we're learning through these conversations here at the corporate office and conversations that we're having with very select Frenchisees like Don Murphy and a few others, right, is so that we can get the right questions into the survey so we can get the right responses and data back, which will help us in that architecture and designs phase, you know, which is immediately to follow. And I would say, kind of keep your thoughts kind of one, two, for us, right? I mean, the three of you guys have probably over 60 years of combined experience, right, between the three of you. And every time we start thinking about, like, what we do here at corporate or what does a franchise you do, it's you can go down these rabbit holes, right? So if we think about what is it best in class solution, what do we want out of this? What do we need out of this? And if you think of it from a net new franchise perspective, we know that every franchise, even corporate, we're going to have to take our use the analogy last night, leave out the cuss word, our round peg and put it into the square hole, because we all are going to be round pegs and square holes coming into this because of all of our tech debt and baggage of what we've done over the years, be a franchise or corporate. So keep in mind, like, what does a net new best in class look like? Everybody else has a retrofit to that kind of scenario. But at the same time, we do have to meet the basic, you know, building blocks and foundations. We can't take steps backwards like, oh, used to do this, but you can't no longer do that, but we're not going to be able to accommodate every single thing for everybody, right? There's going to be a certain amount of conformity that has to happen. You know, we're not looking necessarily today while, you can make technologies suggestions, give us the franchising North Star. What's the vision? What are the goals? What are the immediate shortcomings, you know, that is within our operations and technology that keep us from realizing that North Star vision, or mission and our goals, you, for the next next years. And again, that'll be a driver. We've gotten, from Danny and Brad a pretty good understanding of what they think did the operation is, but the franchising side of the house needs to weigh in, right? And all of us see, because whatever we do, it has to include the franchisees of the future and then begin to create a value and attract the franchisees that we have now, if we're going to go into a unified system. In other words, in other words, are they going to go through change management in order to make, right? What's the benefit and value of creating this brand new architecture such that it's a no brainer for them to do it, as well as, do we have the playbook and tech stack for the next franchise that you sell tomorrow so that they're successful right away, not unlike what some of our competitors are doing. So keep that in mind and as a framework. So just for context, are you the sales team or the or, of your position. name's Kevin. I'm the vice president of franchising. So I oversee all of the franchise business development, operations, Eduardo is our VP of administration and operations. He's been with the company for 20 years. Again, KD is the director of the franchise Operations. She's been in the industry for 50. 18 18 years. I've been with Golds for now seven. Yeah. And so we cover everything from Operations, administration, and Frisevelopment within our team. Gotcha. Sales and support, fact. Okay. Support admin, so these guys really understand the, you know, like the inner workings of the operations and what franchisees are systems are using and stuff like that. Pain points? Yeah. Okay. Per I mean, how do you go through this, team gives you the information as much as we want to say this of what we need. I mean, we're also expecting probably writing some feedback on saying what's best in class is, right? Yeah, yeah, Yes. Yeah, I mean, some of this is best. Yeah. You know, you're franchising background experience going to some of the franchising industry related things. Like part of what I don't fully know in trying to discover and these guys are going to help us from their background experiences, like, what does a good franchise word look like? You know, like, how are they, how are they staffed? How they operate? What do they provide? Where does the line get drawn and what you do provide, what you don't provide as a service, those kind of things. Yeah. I think also just to kind of start, I know this is about the one system, but it's probably important for you guys to know, I mean, we utilize Brand Connect to manage the entire franchise business from franchise development to, you know, reporting. And I think that's ultimately, we would like to have all of the reporting automatically roll up into Frank Kneck, which is it can do and you guys probably work with the organizations that you know, been structured that way and even partnered with Fran Connect. Right now, we don't necessarily have that. We have some manual reporting processes. You know, we used to have, I think franchisees operated off of, you six to eight different platforms at one point. I can work down to like three now. Domestically. Domestically? Yeah. And like, I don't I don't see necessarily see a pathway where this one system is global because there's a lot of, you know, individual country requirements and, you know, laws and banking, you know, you know, variances and barriers. So I don't know what's been discussed on that, but we see this as domestic one system. Potentially maybe Canada as well. Maybe Canada. The most close to the U.S. Okay. Yeah, and that's where we've been talking about. drastic, not global, so. Right. Okay. Understood. Cool... I think, so you guys want us to basically, are we providing information around? Are you guys asking questions for us? However, we want to structure it, we could do either if you've got some top mind kind of things or just like.. franchising? What is it for the next three to five years? What are the goals? And what are the current obstacles that you would say that like the data is not automated into brain connect? What are some of the other systems other than brain to connect that you're using that creates, you, that friction kind of stuff? Maybe Walk us through just a little bit of the big picture and then the day to day.. Would you want to start off the back end side? Or maybe start with the front end side.ither. Or we can start with the, you know, what is the typical franchisee look like? The persona of a franchisee, the typical persona or personas, you know, even, you know, like the footprint and, you know, startup costs and stuff like that. That's, I think that's all, you know, good information. Somewhat. And where it's relevant, I think, is what the product looks like, what the gym looks like, the amenities, you know, what goes inside of a box, typically going forward. I was trying to the different systems are Yeah. You know, like what kinds of systems do we need to support that product? What is additional revenue things like? term res solution, yeah, if it's alike, for sure. Like, what is that, do you believe is comprised of of the turnkey solution to say, this is my package product, I can hand it to you, you can run, go with it without a lot of additional interest. Yeah, so when I think of the one system, you know, I'm I think of what a franchise or should be providing as part of that product. So you know, we clearly have our brand image, our design of our gym, you, the equipment package and layout and why. But then when you get into the digital part, it's the member experience is what you're trying to package everything up into this software, this, you know, one system. You know, so that's the, I think that's a huge kind of summary of what we're looking at, which is the member experience and every touch point that a member might have from, you know, the marketing that they receive before they become a member to the sales process, to the onboarding process, to the lifespan of their membership, you, whatever they choose to their path that they choose within that gym, if they're connected to personal training or proof exercise, or just, you know, general member engagement. I mean, it's, it's a big, broad, brush stroke, but it's everything that impacts that member experience from the beginning to the end. So you have your club management system, utilize qual tricks for member experience management. You know, those are the two franchise facing digital systems that we have. The francnect is solely on and reporting, page, and then we eilize another system called light speech for staff development training to the LMS system. Okay. Include the have in there. The mobile app, you know, we a lot of these club management systems have their own app. We kind of use an add-on right now. Our franchisees are on various apps because we just haven't provided the one solution. And I think sometimes they look at what they're getting integrated into like an ABC and why they're choosing to use their app versus our app. I think those are all the questions that we've got to ask for ourselves is, what is best in class, you? What should we be providing? And we've always had it been the silo business where we've got the company side, everybody working on the company side is got their head down and focused solely on what their business needs are and how they're operating their gyms. And then we've got the franchise side. And we haven't always as a company thought of what's best for the franchise business and the growth. It's always been company, company, company, and that's why we have so many fragmented systems out there on the franchise side because they have needs some of these franchises have been operating gyms longer than our leadership team have been managing this company business. And so, you know, I think when we look at what's out there and what we need to provide, we need to look at what the franchisees are doing and why they're doing that, right? Why do you feel like you need to have this app versus our app? Like, what's missing? Is it valid? Is it I mean, because, again, if we're going to build a world class franchise system, we can't have all these fragmented systems. And when we get a franchise candidate coming in and there's what club management software do we use? Oh, well, you have the option of these two. What is the company James use? Oh, that's a different system than what we use. So and they don't understand as a entrepreneur. Why would we would we not use what you guys are using? I don't know that's just kind of a I would rather you guys ask questions than than we kind of go off on it an area that's not relevant or important. No, I didn't think what you've done there is very consistent with the line that we've been towing, you know, quite a little, which is why we're even having it, you know, the conversations and hearing you express that, you know, is not only comforting, but it cents right. We do want a world class system. It's valid and unify. I love the fact that you've already highlighted first off, it's member experience, right? I wrote that down saying, okay, so when we choose to lean in on a change in process and our technology, we have to think of the B to P to C, you, type of applications that are out there, because while we are B toB choices, the C part is going to be crucial and sometimes you may want to work backwards in what you pick and how you choose. So in that case, then, our franchise members, right, their experience is fully in scope of what it is that we're trying to accomplish or is that? Yeah, that's our product. That's what we're selling as a franchise organization. And then second year, you have the franchise owners owner experience with the technology that we use to manage and communicate with them, and then you also have the franchise team member experience, too. Perfect. But the product that we're selling is the member experience. So back to Mike's, you know question, what is the goals of the future if you had the perfect box to put out tomorrow to another franchise ownership group? What does that look like? Tell us, you square footage and just look and feel and are we going to include recovery? Are we going include wellness? Are we going to focus on fitness? Our classes and our future? Is it just PT? You know, give these guys kind of that Do Star of what we're selling today. We're in for you.s. Did you want this one to record? Yeah, I got a recording. Oh, on yours this recording? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, well because this is on mute, right? Yeah, let's take it off just to be safe. Oh, I didn't know it was muteed that whole time. Yeah. We've got a couple of records. Sorry. Yeah. So, our brand positioned with gold shin is strength and performance. And, you know, that's how we started. You know, 60 years ago, strength training, we kind of morphed into everything for everyone in the 2000s, you know, to about five years ago. And kind of the problem when you're trying to beat everything for everyone, then everyone's your competition out there. And so, when RSG acquired Golds Gym four, five years ago now, Wow, five years ago. The decision was made. Hey, we're going to lean into our DNA and our heritage of strength training and performance training. You know, and what that looks like in the modern world. And that's going to be our focus. Kind of getting away from your standard group X too. And I know like we've got a very mature franchise network out there and company on gyms, where we still are that, everything for everyone, and many, many locations. But I think when you talk about the future of goals and what we've been building and what we've recently built on the company side in Austin, and we have a franchisees that have adopted this as well, is, you know we're getting away from the standard per exercise. We're leaning into the strength training, trying to build the ultimate strength training gym and functional training or we call performance. And any kind of group classes that we deliver, and again, this is not like our set strategy or vision that we've come up with, but I think any group classes that we have in the future should all be structured around strength and performance, which is the brand position. Maybe you have some secondary classes that you have available, but I think that's where we've really got to lean into and focus on. And we're saying the same thing you Yeah, because if, look, if you've got four gyms in your market, you've got a planet, a crunch, an LA, Pos, set of golds, Everyone but Planet is doing group exercise, you know, they might have cycling, yoga, you know, body pump, you know, kickboxing, whatever. We have always struggled to win that battle with those guys, you know? We haven't always had been the most attractive for group exercise. And so if we're going to compete with all these gyms, where do we have the best opportunity to pull their members into our gym? It's strength training and should be performance. I mean, that's who we've always been. We're the only gym brand in the world that doesn't have to convince our members that we are all about strength training. It's a no brainer. Like it's in our look at our logo, right? And so we need to be leaning more into that, and we found that to be successful in the areas that we've actually launched that kind of a platform. So that's kind of where we see the future strategy and the development of golds, really focusing on that and trying to be the best at that, and not be something for everyone. We don't need to play around with being a cycling studio. We're never going to win that battle. People mostly are going to, you know, boutiques to get that kind of experience. So But we don't want to be just a gym where you go to use the equipment. know and that's where we kind of have been caught up in for the last five years, because we haven't yet mapped out what that member experience looks like focused on strength and performance. And you know, because strength can be, it doesn't have to just be for a bodybuilder, right? Or an athlete. Everyone can benefit from strength training from, you know, everyone in this room to maybe our significant others, our kids, our parents, you know, everyone can benefit from that. We have to be able to tell that story and how they can benefit from that in our four walls, right? And so part of that experience is, you know, it's marketing, it's telling that story and trying to make that connection so people want to come to us for that purpose. It's on boarding them, so when they come to us, maybe they don't have a ton of experience, right? Sure, we're going to get the avid weightlifters and gymgoers. But people who are wanting to get involved in strength training, maybe they haven't been before, we have to have programs that are going to support that. So we need the on boarding process has to provide that. We need to have group classes, one to one classes. programming that, you know anyone can utilize what their workout partner. They don't have to, if they're not going to, you know, be involved in personal training. Only like five to 10% of the gym population anywhere works out with the trainer. So what about the other 90 to 95%? You know, they're looking on their phones, they're just getting a workout from somewhere online. So if we're going to lead the strength and performance, we also have to provide that type of training for them. Whether it's on their own, a small group, or one to one. But it should all be focused under the umbrella of strength and performance. A good example is we do have a partnership with hier rocks. I'm not sure if you're familiar with them, but they are all about performance. And so I think we can lean into that partnership. They already have performance training programming. So maybe how do we do we integrate that into our system digitally, right? They have their own platform. How do we connect with that through this one system, just an idea. You know, we have some internal projects within our company for mapping out and developing that member journey. So what does that member experience look like on all touch points? We have another project where we're, we are addressing the needs for the fitness programming. And how do we deliver that? There's another platform that I know our VP of Ops is is working with and they're basically developing this for us. So how do we integrate that into our system digitally? We work with QArix to understand, you know, you get feedback and understand that journey and member experience, how to we integrate that into our overall system. What am I missing, guys, in terms of, like, where we are as a brand and where we're going? Because that is our product, and that's what I need. We all need to sell to investment groups. part of it too, though, you're trying to I mean, would you say, just to make sureigned the more we're saying is we're trying to also elevate that experience? Yes. So that it's not considered in the same categories in HBLP.. you know, Burnett, we had to really sell it. part of us adding amenity, maybe towel service, like what's that an elevated experience, sound system, things like that. Yeah. Because we should be at a higher price point. Yeah. I do think recovery, I think you've mentioned recovery. It's an area I think we'veve missed the dance with for a very long time. And, you, you need to look at what's what are people who are athletes or are in this dr training or performance training? What are they using for recovery? Is it more than just a massage chair that every discount gym has out there, right? So I think we need to take a really good look at that and, you know, some gyms charge more for those services, and so they're integrating their technology to wear, like, I'm a member of several gyms. I'm a member of EEOS. So if I want to use their cold plunge, I have to scan my app to get into that part of the gym, or if I want to use their recovery tools, I have to scan my app to get into that part of the gym, maybe I don't know if we want to go that far, or do we want to be more of a premium offering that has when you join our gym, you get all of this and you don't need to be locked out of anything. Well, I think we all decided Kevin and just I want to make sure we set the tone. So while we have the company, Jones, the growth in future goals is franchise. So when we talk about the one system, it absolutely has to be something that someone would go because of the benefits. I don't want the corporate gy, even though we should be proof for concept for sure, but this has to be when you mentioned, like, everyone needs to be honest this. It's not, oh, we're going to make incentivize it. No, we're going to build it' where they get on it and we can enforce it. There should be no reason for them not to want to be offic.. It has to be a fact. If we do it. If we do this with the right way. Well, yeah, I agree with you saying it, but I'm saying the goal is there's nothing better or it's comparable, worst case to what you have, and, you know, because of everything we've negotiate as franchise or, you know, the cost you know. So we have to look at also. By going back to your question, I just wanted to make sure that's out there because I feel like sometimes it kind of makes sound like, oh, it's nice to have. No, the franchise. It's a must have. It's a must have. So when you talk about the pricing, so I agree with elevated it. To me, the benefit of the brand outside of you, what goals is that they wearing is, is we want to be elevated, but we also want to be you know, nibble enough, like, say rent raids, or demographics. Like, are we saying that there's some markets we don't want to go into? I don't know. That's really for all to determine, but there might be a need to say you have to have a $40 membership that folts on because people can't afford60. But for the company's side, we're going to focus on, and I've talked to franchiseises, you, talking to Matt and Josh or the at their stuff, the recovery gets almost no use. Our recovery at Burnette at a 55, which is seem to go to $60 price point is off the charts, like, to the point where the guys at hyd their like, your message, your average is double or higher. So that's where I kind of feel like the value ad could be the same we are a Celligium, but if you want to go into a market where the rent allows you and you have to have more volume to go 40, than full time, I think you have to have the ability to both. Yeah, yeah. I think sometimes too, like as a company, you know, we have to monetize all the, you, amenities and everything, but don't don't focus on that so much that you actually losing, you know, you're chasing pennies and losing dollars. For sure, right? And a good example is high rocks. You know, we build this incredible training space, but yet we lock people out of it. And you know, if we have 100 people paying for it, but the rest of the members can't use the space, we've probably been better off financially. If we would have added 400 new memberships and just let everyone use that space. Well, that's a fair point, what we could do, and we talked about this because to me, why is it a little helm $60 or $5? And to me, does that mean you get access to high rise? Well, if you ask the GM, he wants to charge $60. And I think we want to go there, so I'm just trying to a little foreshadowing here. But to me, we could add recovery to that huge waste of space. We can definitely want to add the equipment that we need. I think I have a little home in there actually to do that. And the whole idea is so we can increase the pricing and maybe the increased price the entirebox is part of your membership. Yeah. In my opinion and me as a consumer, thinking about like when you buy a car and you get to the end and they're like, do you want the undercoating? Do you want this? You know, anti chip stuff and all the stuff you just say, no, no, no, no, no, you don't want those upgrades. So the auto dealers have said, you know what, we're just going to bake it in as the package. And even though you didn't want the floor boards and this and that and the other, and that wasn't important to you. So V, it's all part of the package and you just buy the car truck, whatever, and you live with it. But people, I feel like, are like, I get everything. It's a value ad for a price point. The upsell upsell upsell, to me is an easy way to people just to say no, no. What all that stuff. They just don't conversation about it. There's we can do to make loan home, 60 bucks and then I mean, the demographics justified. charges from that. totally. I remember were getting there. to me, probably say with those that should be a 55 account. Yeah. I mean, and not to get on track, but you have extra space in that facility, too, to build a kids' club if you want, or a proper recovery, you, off. I think it should be testing for the ultimate recovery. Yeah. I mean, and the good news is that that gym is the demographics there, I mean, that could be a $300,000. It's a surprising a lack of competition, too? reason not to get lean in on that one. Because then you can own that area. That's actually the goal we're trying to get. So that's my for 26, get that down. But I'm trying to say that's kind of an example how we want to elevate the brand to it's not considered in the same conversation with LA fitness and all that is So is that a good example of the we want to be authority in strength and performance? Yes. Yes, yes, because, look, we there is so much competition out there, and the HVLP offerings out there are really good, you know, I mean. EEOS is a formidable. I didn't know they had a location over here off of. They're going to have more in Texas than we have in 2026. That's a lot. And they built a good product. They're operating the exact same business model that we used to operate. And they're former goals, guys, and they just never stopped doing it. They just kept improving it. And they're seeing tremendous success. You know They're given Crunch a hard time. I think they're To me, Crunch is the pl killer, the ES will be their crunch. And so when we look at that spread to all the the that Crunch has. Well, it's going to be a thing for not to go tangent. It's just like their cost is they' doing. I mean, if you look at their price points, though, because, I mean, we pay. My wife and I pay, I think, 20, I don't know, $24, $26 a month, because we got everything in the gym. Yeah, I just pay $ for that. Yeah. Yeah. And so they're just constantly improving it. I mean, their average price point is probably not far off from ours, but they got doubled the number of members. So the feature for us is not to be in every market. You know, I'd rather be, you know, instead of not saying we're going to have $ 500 gyms in the U.S., maybe we're going to have 300 or 400, and they're not going to be everywhere. But they're going to be in markets where we could, you know, charge a higher price point, provide a good offering, and just be like own our field, right? Because you can't compete in a market where you have three or four HBLPs that are providing an incredible product. Can't compete in that., The only way your advantage is you're not as crowded. Yeah, as those jobs. too crowded and you go higher price and and provide us p. And so there might be markets where we can do that in, but, you know, you know, I think we need to be chasing the markets that are like the like little elm or the one we just opened in Austin on Burnett Road. So that's direction for. US franchising. and because so the best part of the franchise business for the last 15 years is an international for us. we continue to grow at a really strong rate. If we lose 50 gyms in the U. US. one year, we add 50 55 international outside of the U.S. We have to be able to attract the more sophisticated investor here in the U.S. P groups. And we can't do that right now because we don't have any of this that we're talking about. You know? What exactly are they asking for? And I've heard some of this, but yeah, I mean, for these guys. They want to know about our tech stack. It's one of the most important things for them. And the tech stack. The very data hungry. The tech stack, that's all. It impacts every part of the member, you know, journey, right? And why they come to us, we don't have any of it. And a concise playbook on. And so that's what we've got to solve. We've got a great brand name, you know, but we don't have, you know, when we talk about the product and the text stack and the offering, like, this is what we have to tighten up. And everything feeds into digital, because for the fitness programming for an example, we have to be digitally digitally digital first, and then human touch as a benefit, right? So it's like, we're providing our members with strength training programming through an app, that they don't have to work with a trainer on. We're providingngth training and performance training. Now, if they want to move into group training, then we're going to offer that as well and then one to one training will be the least used as it is everywhere, right? But we've got to be digital first and foremost, that we're giving something to 100% of the members, and not just focusing on the, you know, 5% that's paying for training. Right. They're on a source that digital instructions on the road, why not come from our authoritative? Yeah. So, like, what, you know, another example are Golds Fit program, you know? It's a great program. incredible training. We even have a certification for the coaches. But we're like,Ah, you know, we don't have only got like 2% of the members or less at actually ever using it. We should have been giving that training out to all the members. We have the space, you know, and the equipment that they can use. The big challenge is when a member goes online and just gets their workout from somewhere else, what if our gym doesn't have that equipment set up? We just had this. They're going to find the gym across the street that might have it. I just did this conversation with Alex, like, in our programming in our digital presentation be specific to the location to the specific equipment in that location. And he's like, I hadn't thought of it. I'm like, well, we can dig deeper. Yeah, so it's like, these are all the things that we have to be thinking about and giving them a reason, like giving them, you know, some digital tools that they don't want to give up, right? Whether that's, I don't know, nutrition advice, motivation tips, you know, something within our digital ecosystem that is giving them a reason and a connection to stay particles, Jim. I mean, maybe we can help we can build a small communities within our tech deack somehow. that keep members coming back to us because they feel part of that. But when we're just a gym to work out in, we're giving them reasons every day to leave us. You know and if they go and join a lifetime or someone else that has better digital ecosystem and more stuff that they're interested in, you know, they might go there. What does a potential franchisee of the future when they come to the table looking for product, as well as what our existing franchiseises look like. We've talked a little bit about earlier in our meeting. You were saying, it can't require new staff. One of the things that we've heard in a lot of the conversations is the reason a lot of these are on ABC currently today is because they do offer that full service. their customer care department, freezes cancellations, processing, all things, or whatever. There was the the one that hopped to Zenot as a trial and and had a bad experience, simply because they don't provide all those things, and it's not that Zenoti is bad, they don't provide it. So as we think about the tech stack, some of the important conversations are going to be, what what do they now have to own because the system doesn't have it or us is the franchise or, and again, this is the broader question of what does a traditional franchise or provide as services such as customer care support or technical support, you know, for various things. So kind of explain how that environment looks like today and what it should look like for the future, I guess. I think that the challenge we have right now is when we bring on a new franchisee, we have to send them out to vendors to help them build out their tech stack, right? We have to send them to ABC, and ABC helps them build out their platform. Based on what their ABC's familiar with and not towards our needs or maybe their needs, they'll line with their brand. They'll lost the franchisee, you know, what kind of memberships do you want to offer? What do you want to do for this? And so they get endless endless options to pick from and it's way too overwhelming, especially if we're going to be bringing on franchisees that don't have previous fitness experience. They're looking to us to say, oh wait a minute, I thought I was going to. I just want the Goldch G package. I have to pay They should be coming to us to sit down and we should be helping them create with an ABC or whatever. Well, we should have it ready to go. Okay, so we're going to have to put a price on your membership, because maybe you charge $20 more on your market, but all the accounts are set ups. menu items are the same. Everything is set up the same. all needs to come back to us in the same format, right? They just manipulate the pricing. Yes, yes. So the ideal solution for net new franchise coming in is not just the technology stack, but the turnkey programming to go along with the playbook. And then we want to give them the keys and their operations made. Okay, well, but are we talking full turnkey? Or when you say build them? Are you talking about just the POS or are you talking about build a G? ' Because we've talked about that I., I think It's. Yeah, let's talk digital. Okay, let's say that. Even if there is a conversation we had around what the gym looks like in the equipment and chain.. I just wanted to clarify. We've got that figured out. physically building.. Well, that was part of an older program that we tried 15 years ago or so we're going to build it.. Let's do what we know we can do later. We can have a template that they say, okay, I'm I should be able to say I've got a new franchisee starting. They're ready to start presale, and we work with the vendor or we have the solutions in-house to be able to help them set up their system. And that should also include right now, we have all kind we don't have a standard chart of accounts, which is a huge issue, especially when we're trying to pull the reporting in house, because we have to map everything.. Yeah, and we got a differently because the vendors have let them pick whatever they want to call a membership or whatever they want to call kids' clubs. So what were? What we've already determined and kind of somewhat, just a know-brainer, is, we will own the common GL structure, right? All things fall into, membership revenue, PT, whatever these buckets of revenues are, that they will be able to say, well, okay, why do Pilates, you do high rocks? Okay, it still fitness training or performance, whatever category it falls into from a GL structure. We own that, we define it, everything falls into that. Again, back to the question. I think that's pretty easy for the net new franchise. So now let's talk a little bit about existing franchisees and the conformity to say, how do we get them to go through what's will be a very painful change management process of retraining, learning us probably involved with data mapping of here's your existing data and memberships and all of the things you've offered over the 19 gazillion years. Just like, we got so much dirty laundry with everything we've offered over all the years to consolidate that into these meaningful buckets of the new way of doing it, right? So back to the round peg square hole scenario is like.. But we need to clean it up. The adoption? Yeah, the adoption of that.. I think most branch. Are they ready? Are ready for it, and most would agree that it's probably long overdue that they did a cleanup of those things anyway. I don't Because they had all kinds of legacy. You go into Don't worry about resistance from them. Yeah. You know, we need to build for the future. And as far as programming. That's what we have to be thinking about, then we'll bring the existing franchiseises into this. Programs do we know that exist out there that have gone outside of the traditional Gold's Gym or even fitness, right? I mean, even like Don Murphy with Golf Bays and and such. Yeah, I mean, look at some point, he might not want to be a Gold's gym anymore. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, he's not really like a gold. The future of this brand, look, the existing franchisees are very, very important. But this brand is going to be built on the backs of the next 50 franchisees. All right, so I believe, as we kind of talked about our focal point is, you know, we know we're going to have to try to clean up all of the mess of both corporate and franchise to get into this new platform, but I think our focus always, that North Star has to be, what does this look like for the net new franchise? And if it's best in class for them, then we should all want to jump to it ourselves. We haven't included your price reminded me of this. is we want to be in the same ecosystem so this reciprocity. We haven't filled, so the pricing becomes an issue with that system V already knows the issue with there because it's got to be able to talk. You mean, like travel past, restaurants? Like there's no travel pass. Like, if you remember Gold's gym, you have access now, if you have to travel if we have to put limits because of the price point, then you're right, is travel pass, but it's digital. But should we live in a world where, if you have a standard model, you should have access to opt if you live. I think we should be able to still have a certain number of visits to each gym and then maybe if you've got a market where you've got multiple franchisees or franchisees with corporate, then there could be an alliance and then I think the system has to be able to understand that and that membership type. Is that not a determinator you're trying to find the? The reason I'm asking is, we're talking about best in class and that's kind of like you know, with Prime, sheet, you do get limits to where you can go. But if it's a price point, you're paying.. You should get all access. And there's a little. But to your point, if it's more than a certain amount of limits then you know, you probably need a chance. I think there's also got to be that factor if you if you live in that market now, you need to transfer your membership.. So that franchise owner can receive the red. You've had alliances in the past, and they've. I have always been super messy. No, I do the. Well, I think instead of.ructive. I think we should discuss internally the concept of to Danny's point. Like, there should be membership tiears. And if somebody's willing to pay a certain amount.. We're not to go detail now. I just want to make sure. you should have a certain amount of access to go to any club, right? I mean, what I'd like to hear from you all, I think of kind of alluded to this is what is best in class? That needs to be the next discussion so that we can then say, oh, well, what about this, this and this? I mean, you guys work with Crunch. Look, I know in South Beach, it's $100 a month for a membership there. It's not $9.99. And so, how's their reciprocity work? Yeah. Similar to UFC gym, they also have gyms outside of the U. US. How do they track their travel pass or their member reciprocity? We do it with a paper card today. Like a business card? Yeah. We can't do that. No. like a free sandwich stamp your card.. We need a digital solution that can. So that's another thing to think about. Let's say a US gym member travels overseas. How do we digitize something to where that, you know Master Franchisee and India can see that they're a member in the US and allow them to enter their gym. I don't know how we work that out? Well I think in a nutshell really quick? Yeah. We've done just look up, like you don't kind of look up into the other system and it's just saying, oh, okay. Veriication. And then as far as like domestically and you know, specific markets, it always has been kind of a, and we talked about this yesterday, you know, it kind of balances out, you know, but if somebody ends up working out more in one gym, the home club is transferred. You know. And I'm just, I want to stay out with this for a second. So let's say I'm trying to find a solution for this global reciprocity. Let's say. like international or Yeah, so let's say a member from India comes to Austin. and wants to work out. Look, examples EEOs, I can bring anyone into the gym with me and they can work out for free if they're with me. But you're gonna log into their system so they can now track your visits, right? So I think we need to be able to have a similar system to where a member from India comes into my gym, I'm a franchisee. You, we log them into our system, so now we can also track their visits, and we can also verify that, hey, yeah, there're still a member. But now I have them in my system, so I can track this properly. Yeah. It has been a system on top of all the dealers. It's been like a meta system. Yeah. So, you know, that's future it's like a daily link or whatever, and have a thing. the rest and most. And then when I speak, and that we're talking about, like, I'm always thinking global because that's the selling point as well. So obviously, this system may not match, but whether it's like there's a DNA to our, you know, gym past, and when they see it, they know this is a gold gym. member that's part of the US network, I don't know, like how we do that or because it's a QR look up that they can scan and say, oh yeah, this tax them. I don't know. But there does need to be that in kind of. But but we need to own that and say, okay, this is how USAU franchisee or an existing one coming into this new system, this is how you're going to track all of this. We've got everything built in. Now we can teach you how to utilize it, but that's part of this, one system. Yep, y. And kind of where my head went when I'm thinking of the solution on this, that addresses international. Domestic's not that big of a deal because we know we can tap into a couple of ass systems and be done. But with multiple international systems now in the mix, right, it's like you have all these data sources of members, and there is no centralized hub of that. So an easy turnkey solution that that's not trying to integrate with 48 different point of sales in ones that might have even different languages or what have you, is platform, a very simplistic platform that is this gold travel pass platform that every franchisee has a log into, and if Katie says, I'm going to be traveling, she has to request that, and it can be digitally requested. She doesn't have to walk into the gym or whatever. It can be through any means to be able to say, I need to request it to my home gym because they're the ones that are going to say, yes, she is a good paying member. They basically flag her on said date as active in this global travel pass environment with X number of visits. I think it's it 13, 17, 15? 14 I almost got it. The one number didn't. Yeah. And from that point on, she walks into any gym, she wants to walk into, you know, and on the other side, visiting gym, she says, oh, I'm visiting, I'm not in your system. They go to this website that is the global lookup. They have their own login, boom, they can quickly scan her barcode, and it finds her and says, okay, she's got 14, they decerment the session, so now she only has 13. Most people, and you wouldn't. It'd be nice for this just to all work and tie together where everyone at any point in time is already set up and ready to go. But the reality is, there is a lot of work to that, so it almost does have to be a per request. Like, you have to initiate the I will be visiting some other gym to initiate that past request through your home gym kind of concept or whatever. So I don't think it, I mean, again, it depends on how much money you want to spend. You know, you can look to integrate with every single POS, but I think to your point, it sits outside and on top of talks to some of this data somehow, but doesn't we're not in a place where we're gonna be implementing integrations to every single point of sale system used by every international. I mean, right now we have the manually the best person calls, home gym, and says, "Hello, I've got Kevin Christie here," and he's trying to use his travel pass and they have to look them up. Iss there an AIA for me to request that in some sort of hub and it to say, okay, this home gym and it can go in and check and verify Kevin's membership is active. Well, this would be the international gyms, because once we get this one system in the U.S, it should be able I mean, they're all connected somehow. Domestically, it can be.., you're always going to have. Without an integration to every single point of sales system, to verify as Kevin Christie, an active member in, you, Japan, you either have to have an integration. I mean, call it whatever technology, you know The YMCA does this. They do it. Okay. Well, that's what ours is too. Yeah, per location? Per location. In total. So if you go to Japan, go to Tokyo G 14 days. They're actually longing 14 per location. versus 14 in total. That's what we do. That's what we do, yeah. Because we're not able to track how many visits they've had at other gyms, there would be no way. Well, but the program, the global workout program states that it's 14 visits per location. Just lifetime or like a certain period? I think it's annualized. It's a mobile system. So if you go to Tokyo and then you. But they have to use a different system. form the country. 14 days. scam now. Another thing we haven't talked about yet is having some sort of layer of AI functionalities for their serum and their lead follow up. Right now, we've got franchisees that are going out on their own and finding these solutions and testing them out and they're asking us for help and resources and what should I do and we're kind of like. We don't know. Tell us what you're doing. And it would be like, I think this just goes back to the point of we have to be the. Innov reader. We have to be leading the innovation. We have to be leading innovation and then supporting them and being a reses having to react to This is like where you have, we have to kind of change our our thought process from a company standpoint because our franchisees are entrepreneurs. You know, they're gun and innofate. They want to continue to be successful and find the competitive. They' going to conferences and seeing things. We as a company have just kind of been sitting back, you know, taking the. I would say taking the, not to say, not to say anything negative, but it's like, we just kind of sit back and continue business as usual and don't think about that. Because, you know, I mean, our team's employees, right? Franchisee's a business owner. They're going to think differently than Ryan might be thinking over here today, right? And so, like, how do we partner with some, software, you know, companies that can help us, like, with that innovation and lead. The other thing I think we should think about, and I've shared this with Ryan and Rick, is Danny and Brad. Whoever we choose if possible, we need a partner for our club management system that's willing to grow build with us, not just, hey, you fit into our system as it is today and as everybody else has. The other the other thing that I want to get out before I forget it if we've got every U.S franchisee on one system, we are by us sending them out to other vendors, you know, we receive zero rebate or money back from their billing. So all the current ones right now, you have no. Nothing. Okay, nothing. Like, I know some franchiseers charge a dollar, $5, $10 per member join. Plus, they're getting a percentage of that building every month. Like, you want to talk about changing the direction of our business financially about That's what we need a partner who's willing to do that crunch those $5 per joint online. $5 to join online. We had a conversation about that. There's a lot of money to be made on the transactions on the backside. Oh, my gosh.ions as a franchise or there's lots of different ways you can. get a lot of. We need to know what that's going to be ahead of time because we' to incorporate that into our disclosure document. for future agre. Oh, yeah, we't get by theation? Yeah..house. Yeah. I mean, well, I mean, ultimately the franchiseising paid. Some of you can do a couple things. You can say it's a $5 per kind of a thing like crunch or the buy rate in which we might get through the payment processing could be X, but we sell it to our franchisees as X plus two, right, which means we're getting the two basis points, you know, as a rebate from. There's a lot of different ways in cat that extra money as you did all at H, and they should be explored, you're right. It's a revenue stream. And this could support having the staff that's gonna help support them, and've got.. Absolutely. issues with the platform, like that could pay the Yeah, there's a lot of through that around that.. It's not like we're going to do that to make extra money. Like, that's. You don't have to sit out to the same. Okay. Go up in here. Yeah, that was me earlier, but I was earlier the same. I'm like, I'm about to have to run out of here, I think, to take a phone call. family emergenency this morning. I was like, "No, I'll just sit back over here in the corner and I haul ass out of here." Rick, as far as the building, I think you might know, remember, we actually did that with a few franchisees, 15 years ago, were trying to make.VB? Yeah, where we had the bill. Now, I'm not saying that we go back to that, but that's just something else to describe it. We talked a little bit about that, and part of what we talked about was, you know, the concept of a best in class franchise or, and what we have to support to make sure everyone is successful, and we did that play under Aaron Watkins with Kim Yman's plans and products, new items being input in the system, you know, Tracy's team's responsible for billing or whatever. Billing, not so much, that's pretty straightforward and easy and repetitive, but for Kim, it was the Friday 4 o'clock. I've got five new items. I need you to add to this system, even though the policy was, you know, you got to provide things within a 72 hour window in advance, right? And just so part of what's scary to me is this concept of we are now owning and taking on a lot of new responsibility when our company mentality has been company Jim focused and my concern is, are we going to understand day one all the things new responsibilities as a franchise or that we're going to be responsible for, to support, maintain, deliver, configure, we own it, and are we staff for it, or franchise is going to be knocking under door, you know, it doesn't matter whether it's Friday at 4 o'clock or Sunday because they have a weird issue, and they don't know how to solve for it, and they don't have the rights to call up the vendor directly because we own the relationship or what have you, like, to me, that's one of my biggest concerns is, what does a franchise or look like today from a footprint standpoint of staff employees, people, support all those things, such as a crunch or what have you, because we're definitely not there, in my opinion. I think there's a spectrum, like anytime fitness, for example, they even offer customer, like care support, right? So they're centralized customer care team is also answering calls for franchise gyms on.. And I think as long as you have a standard play, you can do that. Imagine having to pick up the phone and say, "You belong to what gym? I have no clue what your phra on. There is way, right? But I think if we we own a tech stack, then we need to have some internal support that's going to be otherwise, they're going to still always use the vendor. Yes, absolutely so I think. How do these gym chains that have a thousand, 2,000 gyms in the U.S? How do they do it? Some people charge for services. I mean, we need to be set up similar to that. Yeah, I mean, sometimes we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes the hill at for those same services, so also be able to ABC will compensate the franchise ore sometimes, too. If they don't have functionality and it takes humans to do something, they'll, you know, pay for half of an employee's salary, you, at the franchise or. Yeah. I think if we setting up a new.. setting up a, like when we're talking about bringing on new franchisees and and like, how do we, the tech stack and everything should be set up in a manner where everything, that's mostly automation, right? And not a lot of like manual labor. Like. How do we not have so much manual labor to manage this process? Well, okay, so Think about us with our 50 clubs. I think we do way too much manually, though. We've made this thing sochaic and complicated. But think about like just, did the turnover employees, right? I mean, every other day there's a new front desk person or whatever.. As nice as it would be to fully automate that, they're just human touch points, such as, okay, could we automate something that says, this person was hired as a front desk employee?" So when they're most of the log in is created today, their role is for desk. Yes. There's a linkage back to the 80P payroll to get their ID. So when there's things that are commission-based, or, you know, whatever, it's got to tie back to pay. There's just things that can't, unfortunately, the only one doing that out there is every brand having those same exact issues and problems and have so much manual? I missed the exact exact scenario you was talking about, but going back to like the system setup, pricing, packages, all that, a lot of it is pretty manual. And that's where a lot of franchise wars, you know, get in trouble too, because it's the same thing across the board, four o'clock on a Friday night. I need to add something and then pretty soon. You have like 20 SKw items for the same water bottle, you know? And you don't know how to map it and yeah. Well, you can lock down the guard rows that we can put with that particular vendor right in the corerangements system is then, do they have Brand level controls, right, to where it can be made ones and then pushed properly? Yeah, right? So there's where we're going to find efficiency. You'll never avoid somebody manually doing that, like a kim, right now, or Kim's, right has a test to be a team, on behalf of multiple franchiseises who want to put in a special for the weekend or whatever, but our job in is to pick the vendor that has the control where she doesn't have to touch 200 clubs.. Where today she used to touch 50 in Moo, well, even that is too many, she should do it once and then check the boxes. This is the date that this comes live. These are the it's online for these, whatever. That'll be our part to kind of go in and what you're seeing and create efficiency and the workflow. But there should be a lot of like self, because right now franchisees have more access to do that kind of thing on their own than like our company gym staff does, right? We do it here centrally for all the gyms, but they would be able to go in. So that's where we have to make some decisions, right? Because Brad was talking about it even yesterday is, do we continue to give them full autonomy or a partial autonomy? In other words, here are the brand across the brand, we are offering these two things that you pick your price. And if you want to throw in something unique, maybe I give you a chance to be. But fix thatplify. the price because they have to. They're, you different national angles. I mean, I don't see any time franchisees is coming up with super crazy stuff. It's pretty standard across people times. To scale you got to make it simple like that. different pricing.. It is a simple model. And the cheeseburger might come with lettuce and equip. Well, that's what I mentioned the other day is a pop up for Domino's Pizza 50 off was their deal, right? And just threw off these conversations. I'm like, what if I put in a California zip code where the price of everything is higher?" Still, the national offer, the offer across the board, consistency was $50 off of any large premium pizza. But that pizza was $99. The difference was about four and a $4 difference higher there than here, but other than to your point, same menu, different price points. That's all it is. Yep. I think we still have some maybe curated, curated menu of, you know, the dollar to join or the zero enrollment, like the common things that we as a brand have approved. This is a promotion that we run, that we support, that we have marketing assets to go along with it. And then they would have the ability to kind of flip those on or togle those. Can I say a quick question? So. ultimately, we need to land on what is the product that you guys are going to franchise? Passes the past, Cornina Brad, right? So what is that clearly laid out in designed? We've been asking everybody, so we're trying to see where there's discrepancies, because that's super helpful. And then number two is what is the business model associated to that? Because that in essence is all your resources and pricing and all that type of stuff. Because for example, I built one of the first recovery studios in 2018 and in Buck in Boston and we put it out there and unless we priced it into the membership or super deep in program, it's not going to get used, right? Everybody else is using it to bump up to the black card and b up to that. tons of good data there, but that's a business model decision, and I still have not full clarity on product and business model of this new product, regardless because we already know the product of the passes we let the product change every time we sold it, basically. And I'm curious that that's clearly articulated because we should build a stack for that. versus just purely take what everyone else is here, you know? When you say product, what, what do you? The, the box. The product of amenities. In essence, I've heard 30,000 square feet around strengthen performance, that's kind of the plan going to. I've heard 22 to 30. So I guess, example, recovery. And I work with the guys at hierarchs, so is this is the high rocks training certier or you have performance center, right? They're working on a tech tack, too. That's getting integrated with ABC right now. Like, so, if I understand all those components, then I kind of know what's going on in the back, because in essence, we've got a land on a dustoles. So, I mean, I think part of this was discovery, right? They're learning about our business. I'm hoping that it also is turning on some light bulbs on like, oh, yeah, we need to be thinking about how this is going to work. What is this going to look like? What is the consistency here? Who owns this area versus a franchisee has to manage this aspect versus we do it as the employer, our business model is, these things are inclusive of price points, we're shaving off a $1., $2. $3 per joint online or whatever transactional fees, services or whatever. So I think at some point, after the conclusion of today, we should all circle back internally, probably between, you guys are key, right? This is your turnkey product you're gonna offer for new franchise. We have a lot of the responsibility to also figure out how do we retro everybody else into it? But we should probably have a conversation between you, Danny Brad, all the right players in the room to kind of say, let's really think about what does our product look like? And to your point, the business model behind it, and if we need more clarity on exactly what you're looking for, I guess we'll ask, but to me, that's very important, right? I mean, it's. We all get in the room and we talk about it, we all know what we need to do. It's been talked about for, whatever.. I mean, look, we talk about the product and you know, what is the product, okay? It's the facility. It's it's the branding. It's the materials you're using to build it. It's the equipment package, that's we have that I figured out, okay? It's all clear. It's documented, we have a process on making sure that that's what's built. The product, to me, is more than that. That's part of it. It's the member journey, the member experience overall. That's a project that needs to be done. finished. And it's an And it's the technology that goes along with that. That's a project. That needs to be finished. And as we discussed, yeah, the call prior to this... That's what we need to grow the franchise things. Our responsibility with the franchise team is to develop the brand with you franchise partners and existing partners, and it's to support the franchisees using all of the tools of the systems and the product that's available to us. Our responsibility is not to develop that from the franchise team. Now, we're willing we're part of these projects, but we've been talking about this for four years now. And so And I think it's also important to know that we might have until October of 2027 on the company gyms to switch for Moso, but we don't have that much time with the franchisees, 'cause right now we are down to, we only have two gyms that are not on an improved vendor and we've never been here before. We're trying to keep everybody. This is our chance. Not moving off to another one. All of the franchisees are talking about it when you have conversations with you. They're willing willing to make a change. They say, I hate you. If we wait two years, they're going to be like. We figure out what we're doing. We're just going to keep doing our own thing because you guys can't deliver on anything. That's our frustration where we talked about with Brad about like, we need to figure out like what we're trying to solve for. and then go specifically solve for these things. For example, a lot of the reason people are still on ABC is because finally they purchased train rising gave them a mobile app and a concept and some of the digital things that they need, nutrition, all those things, right? Where are we with providing that? Well, according to Robbie, give me five or six months, because we don't have that in place yet. The technology or the programming in its entirety. So it's. I mean, they should be looking at demotu to see how that can integrate with the rest of the systems, right? The are right now. We just starting those conversations yeah, this last week. And part of what, you, we'll be doing.. If that's going to be the path be choose. Yeah.. And yeah, it's it's getting in with a small vendor like that can be great, or it can be a total shit show, right? If they're super small, they're willing to do anything for us. But if they're only willing to do that because they're just trying to survive as a business, we have this idea. It's great. We realize we dumped a shit ton of capital into it to get it to where it is, but we don't have any clients. Please, we need to land a big account. I feel like that's kind of where we're at. You kind of got those. That's a scary place. I mean. I think I think sometimes you've got to take those risks. right? Because like, I think our history has been. Let's take the path of the least resistance, and sometimes that means doing nothing, and we're fine with that. Yeah. That's been our history.. That's why where we're at today. Like, we don't want to take any risks at all. So let's just do the easy bags, which is nothing. And then you're like decade behind your competition on every front. Yes. You know? And, you know, we're responsible to move the brand forward, you know, increase the revenue from the franchise business, the company gyms, and then, you know, we have challenges doing that because we have failed to keep up and provide best in. So one of the things that Rick will be doing a lot of simply because I still have the legacy history of 18 years with the company, and people come to me for all the daily needs of all of our company gyms. He's fresh, he's not in the weeds every single day, so he's going to put his product hat on. I'll be obviously a big part of it as well, but like, we met with Alex last week. We got some insight into the Motu. We'll continue to look at not only some of the things that were specifically asked for as far as integrations back in the Moso. That's great. That's for us, it's a solve, it's only a solved for the next year, or as long as we're on Moso. We need to better understand the product as a whole, right? And we talked about getting a log in to go and look at it. You really understand, because that was news, to me, that conversation with, oh, we're looking at this as a holistic. We have a white labeled Golds Gem Les Mills product that has already been built. I don't know what it costs per gym, and I know Les Mills is very pricey, but if somebody said,W need to throw something in the app tomorrow, is there? Dom Murphy is paying for it for his gyms? We choose not to provide it. Again, maybe we negotiate costs. What is it for $1 150 gyms? And it's low enough, you know, at that economy's a scale to we say, we're going to plug it in, and boom, it's there. Tomorrow versus six months when Demotu might or might not be, you know, the right. Yeah, or you could do both. I mean, they'll let those programming is one go, but the prescriptive exercise that the personal trainers or the AI is going to do, is something different, and they both can exist side by side. Sure you really want to be honest. Yeah, but he's not wrong. I mean, the app, just having rolled out, I think we believe in 60 days of what we do in the app will really set the stage and build some confidence and start to attract the franchise into and what what we have is the bare bones, because that's what we need to get it launched. But I think we're going to pour into that. We're going to look at those opportunities and we'll match up then with Dumotu inbody and some of the other internal systems that we probably are going to take into our future, regardless of the core system of Moso or not Moso. I just I didn't want to get into the nuances and that particular discussions were in the right place, but from what I saw of DeMotu, okay, it's cool, whatever, but when you're talking about a digital solution or whatever, that's a client trainer relationship with a process that was built with a specific path you go down with a body analysis and, you know, all that movement, and then to just say, I should be able to go into the app and say, here's digital workouts, and demotu is that, unless it's just a becomes a CDN and a content delivery network, you know, this hub of cloud hosted workouts and such. Like, I don't think they're anywhere near being ready for that., as AI, but you're not wrong. The personalization is there. Look, we're well over time. You guys can' us a ton of really good really good stuff, and we could go on and on and dig through. We do need to spend a little bit of time and business, the partnhips and then marketing's on their way in the door. But this is the first, I think of a few more conversations? We're here. We're here for you guys. these guys.. Questions come experience. Yeah. Thank you. We can help do. Let us know what you guys need. If there's any gaps in, you know, what's needed and from the franchise side. We're always. You painted a good pictures. Thank you. And we want, you, these guys are here for two days, we wanted to get some ons sites and, you know, meet face to face, but obviously, there's going to be a lot of pop ups meetings to continue the conversations.. Critical to the future of our business. Absolutely. That's why you guys are here.. Okay, I have to ask you this, so I don't forget. I've always wondered, what about the RSG digital content that they already have, like, is their syn there that we could also? They don't They don't have them. They got rid of it. That whole cybererobics. It wasn't the people't fully developed anyway? So it never existed as a complete. Is that the pandemic response? online? Yeah. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. The brainer spent a lot of money on a lot of things. Nice meeting you guys. Nice meeting you, too. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Appreciate. appreciate. Thanks, Dr.. Nice to you, too. Thank you. Nice meet you.. For you at us, Thornton recently, I was, yes. Okay, you were. Yes, yeah. Did you meet with Kyle and Beau. Okay, perfect. Yeah. And I heard that's probably a good model to look at. Yeah, I was gonna say that.. I heard, like, we were talking with Calem, we're talking with Don Murphy, I was like.. Aaron and I apologize. We had up. Weate kind of on the outkirts And, now you have five minutes for me. I'm to make sure, because that'll be that. I. It was kind of like, my kind of people that we are here Ky, like what Brad wants. But the plan is there's other's here on a list of others that will res kind of can hear, but you have somewhere else me in the next time. I'm not sure. I know. I was to. I was supposed to be on Cre I Coltr knows more than anybody else in the room. For good. I was planning bad, but going here next for the most part there. I're really going to be. We can swap. marketing's on their way in. We good, you know, if you have any other clubs that you think are like the model the future. Is there a break after what Kevin was saying the futures the next 15 franchisees? Next? And the type of franchise that you want to sell in Jam and you want to sell. Let us know back 1230. We'll sample. So we'll think about for sure Does somebody live close to them? Is there leaving, you said, right? I grew up in Denver, and I was there last week.. I just happened to, based in San Diego. Okay. So do a surv going away now. Okay. So we'll get. So, yeah, I mean, we travel. We have another one and another franchise. Okay.'s list. I'll stop.anchise, so that's like 45 minutes. Yeah, yeah. East of. And it's not part of their group? It'so. Oh, really? Okay. I think that they would have covered that whole northern Colorado. It's kind of a dicey story, but. the two franchisees don't quite get along very well, but. Oh, Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, he was originally supposed to purchase a gym from the owner, and then that fell through, and so he was going to open up his own. Oh, Gotcha. There're far enough apart where it's totally allowed, but in their minds, they're too close. Right, yeah, yeah, I hear you. Well, yeah, if there's any other, you, gyms you think we could sample that is the future, would love to visit those as well. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Thanksgi. I know we'll tap into you a way more? Yeah. Going forward. I a little more about things. I' Yeah, I'm gonna get a deep with them maybe this next week. It's, basically, if you put the camera up and it analyzes your your motion, and then their AI will get prescriptive exercise to potentially balance some things. But then there's a whole programming back end and some other things that we Alex wants the trainers going in on in order to write their programming that much better. Right now, it's not beat to scene. Although you and I could go and get it and do it ourselves. But goals is leveraging it's a B to B today, but with the idea that it'll be a B to C and likely then be housed in the app so that any prescriptive stuff that I want to send to you, or that we allow them to develop for themselves as Kevin was suggesting, that would be the platform in which they redo it. and then even more than specialized like Wipgong wants to do a prescriptive workout for the equipment at that location. So the library has to be per location of the machines that they have I'm saying, when you come to this facility, here's. I' bring m down your workout. As if we could tap into the whatever kind of maintenance service, technology that we have in the service chain or whatever, so that it has that in able. That could be a nice way to get loaded. I feel like that's. That's maybe something. I'm not sure what that was in your bubbles. Like, the service maintenance. No, but I'll add it.quipment, we call it, and gaset.. You equipment repair any maintenance or whatever. Yeah,ware. That's another, like, I'm sure you notice the little QR codes. Oh, yeah, it was it was definitely something that QA related when we were there in this facility, you know,. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Jake, you wanted to move the timing and I told him no.'cause I didn't move it to win. Yeah, exactly. Um, this afternoon sometime. I'm like, these guys don't even at 1 o'clock. Yeah. I mean. If we can go tracking down somewhere still here, not out at lunch, we can say, you can have 1230 to 1 No, I already moved Aaron 1230, so. Okay..? How are you, man? You good? Yeah, doing good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, my dad had health scare this morning. Oh, I started my day off I think it's fine. He's had a major heart attack before, so I got that phone call from the. We did a quadruple on my daddy's. That was scare. I wouldn't feel like I could do
