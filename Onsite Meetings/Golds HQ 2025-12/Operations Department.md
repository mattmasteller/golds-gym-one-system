**GOLDS Operations Department 2025-12-09**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Performance and Integration Challenges with Motionsoft:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed significant performance issues and API integration limitations with Motionsoft, highlighting slowness, downtime, and technical roadblocks that impact club operations and scalability.

- - **Performance Issues and Downtime:** Teams Hub 1 described ongoing performance problems with Motionsoft, including system slowness where member check-ins are delayed by up to 15 seconds, and noted that while the system boasts high uptime, the user experience is negatively affected by latency and slow processing.
    - **API Integration Limitations:** Robert and Teams Hub 1 explained that Motionsoft's API has functional and performance limitations, such as the inability to easily update or add new forms of payment unless a payment method is already on file, which complicates processes like membership renewals and compliance with PCI standards.
    - **Renewal and Payment Automation Challenges:** Teams Hub 1 outlined difficulties in automating renewal reminders and payment collection for paid-in-full memberships, as the current technology does not support collecting new payment information efficiently, leading to manual interventions and compliance concerns.
    - **Collections and Default Rates:** Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed the collections process, which involves internal efforts for the first 90 days followed by outsourcing to a third-party company, and confirmed an average default rate of 7-8%, noting that even small improvements in this rate are significant for the business.
- **Access Control and Amenity Integration:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert reviewed the current state and future considerations for gym access control systems, including gate integrations, 24/7 operations, and the need for flexible amenity management through technology.

- - **Gate Integration Limitations:** Teams Hub 1 explained that Motionsoft only integrates with the Ganttar gate control device, while their physical gates are supplied by Vonsol, creating a technology hurdle for expanding gate-controlled access, especially as only a subset of gyms currently use gates.
    - **24/7 Operations and Demographics:** Robert clarified that about a third of clubs operate 24/7, with this model being more suitable for younger, urban, or medical center demographics, while suburban locations typically do not require round-the-clock access.
    - **Amenity and Service Integrations:** Teams Hub 1 described integrations with systems like towel tracker and wellness equipment, emphasizing the need for future-proof APIs that allow for flexible access control and amenity management, such as granting access to recovery rooms or specialized facilities based on membership status.
- **Automation and Manual Process Pain Points:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert identified several manual and inefficient processes in operations, including promo scheduling, cancellation workflows, and website limitations, and discussed the need for automation and improved system integration.

- - **Promo Scheduling and Website Automation:** Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed the manual process required to update and schedule promotional offers, noting that the current website lacks automation features, leading to delays and increased risk of errors, and identified the need for add-ons or embedded widgets to streamline this process.
    - **Cancellation Workflow Challenges:** Teams Hub 1 described the internal cancellation website used by club staff, which was intended to automate cancellations but is hampered by unreliable APIs and complex business rules, resulting in frequent workarounds and manual interventions.
    - **Complexity of Agreement Terms:** Robert and Teams Hub 1 highlighted the difficulty in automating cancellation paths due to the variety and complexity of membership agreements, and discussed the need for future systems or AI tools that can interpret agreement terms and automate the process while allowing for managerial overrides.
    - **Legal Compliance and Member Experience:** Teams Hub 1 emphasized the importance of complying with 'click to cancel' regulations, ensuring that cancellation is as easy as sign-up, and described the current process where members submit requests online but staff must still process them manually due to system limitations.
- **Adoption of AI and Digital Tools:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed the rollout of AI-powered tools such as the Reply phone concierge and the potential for agentic AI to automate both member-facing and back-office functions, as well as the use of add-ons like Talon One for promotions and referrals.

- - **AI Concierge Implementation:** Teams Hub 1 described the recent rollout of an AI phone concierge (Reply, formerly Hey Libby) designed to provide single-call resolution for basic inquiries, route calls appropriately, and send relevant links via text, with the goal of improving operational efficiency.
    - **Agentic AI for Operations:** Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed the broader potential of agentic AI to automate a range of tasks, from back-office processes to direct member interactions, and agreed that future systems should incorporate such technologies for both B2B and member-facing applications.
    - **Promo Code and Referral Management:** Teams Hub 1 and Robert explained the use of Talon One as an add-on for managing expiring promo codes and referral tracking, noting that while it currently supplements their system, the long-term goal is to have these functions natively integrated into a unified platform.
- **CRM and Personal Training Integration:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert reviewed the ongoing implementation of HubSpot as their CRM platform, aiming to centralize data from various sources and streamline personal training onboarding and engagement processes.

- - **HubSpot CRM Rollout:** Robert confirmed that the marketing module of HubSpot is in limited use while the sales module is under development, with plans to integrate phones, text, digital movement assessments, and inbody data to create a centralized management platform.
    - **Personal Training Onboarding:** Teams Hub 1 inquired about the onboarding process for personal training, and Robert indicated that while the process itself is adequate, the focus is on ensuring all relevant data can be managed efficiently within the CRM once integrations are complete.
- **Dashboard and KPI Management:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert discussed the current state of KPI tracking, the use of Qualtrics for member experience metrics, and the need for a unified dashboard to provide transparency into both company and franchise operations.

- - **KPI Tracking and Qualtrics:** Teams Hub 1 noted that both company and franchise operations use Qualtrics to track member experience KPIs such as friendliness, cleanliness, and Net Promoter Score, but acknowledged that KPIs are currently scattered across systems.
    - **Unified Dashboard Vision:** Robert emphasized the need for a single dashboard that consolidates all relevant KPIs, particularly for executive-level metrics like member count and revenue, and highlighted the importance of transparency in franchise revenues for royalty calculations and performance comparisons.
- **Franchise Billing and Revenue Transparency:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert addressed the complexities of franchise billing, the prevalence of exceptions and manual processes, and the need for a standardized, automated system to ensure accurate and transparent revenue reporting.

- - **Manual Billing and Exceptions:** Teams Hub 1 described the current franchise billing process as highly manual, with numerous exceptions and special cases that complicate automation, and noted that even domestic operations face similar challenges.
    - **Audit and Data Access Limitations:** Teams Hub 1 and Robert explained that while the franchise agreement allows for periodic audits, actual visibility into franchise financials is limited, often relying on self-reported numbers and tax records, underscoring the need for a system that enforces transparency.
- **Club Staffing Structure:**

Teams Hub 1 and Robert clarified the current staffing model in clubs, which consists of general managers and assistant general managers, with responsibilities streamlined compared to previous models.

- - **Managerial Roles and Responsibilities:** Robert explained that each club is managed by a general manager and an assistant general manager, both responsible for operations and production, and that the previous model with multiple managers and sales staff has been replaced to reduce overhead.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **API Limitations and Automation for Membership Renewals:** Investigate and propose solutions to automate reminders and notifications for paid-in-full memberships coming up for renewal, ensuring compliance with PCI and data collection requirements. (Teams Hub 1)
- **Promo Code Automation and Integration:** Clarify the process and integration needs for Talon One and promo code management, including expiration and referral tracking, and determine if it should be handled by digital marketing or another team. (Teams Hub 1, Robert)
- **Website Automation for Promotions:** Identify and implement a solution to automate the scheduling and activation of new promotional offers on the website to reduce manual intervention and breakage points. (Teams Hub 1, Robert)
- **Cancellation Process Automation:** Evaluate and recommend improvements for automating the member cancellation process, including the use of AI to interpret agreement terms and minimize manual intervention by GMs. (Teams Hub 1, Robert)
- **CRM and Fitness Integration:** Coordinate with Alex and the fitness team to provide a detailed explanation of the current and planned use of HubSpot CRM, including which modules are in use and integration plans with other systems (e.g., phones, text, digital movement assessment, InBody). (Teams Hub 1, Alex)
- **Dashboard and KPI Consolidation:** Work with Danny and Brad to develop a unified dashboard that provides complete transparency into franchise and company-owned gym revenues and KPIs, ensuring royalty calculations are based on factual data. (Robert, Danny, Brad)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

Matt and Mike here who's with our consultancy with regards to you know the one system. You guys got a little bit of a brief, you know, from Ryan as to where we're going, what we're trying to do. This is not an audit in any manner as to where are good or bad. This is purely a discovery for the gentleman to have a better understanding of who we are, how we operate, what we're leveraging in tech, uh, what what things are difficult for us, what's our vision, you know, if we're down the road. I'm not going to put a lot of words in their mouth, and I'll let them introduce themselves and maybe the two of you can introduce exactly what you do for us and Robbie as well in that way. Let them kind of like peek your brains right for the next hour and get an understanding. They have the PowerPoint document that you send over to me last week. They've got operations documents from the franchise organization you know, as artifacts to help them discover, but really, it's about the conversation. There'll be one today. Yeah, and just to add to that, if you think about like when SNP came in to do it just an overall company audit, I felt like everybody was showcasing who I am and what my work is. This is not what this is about at all. This is about understanding our business, the good, the bad, what works, what doesn't work, we don't want to sugarcoat anything, and act like we're in a good place because in some areas we're not. As far as being a franchise or, we're not, we don't really do anything on behalf of the franchisees, or very few of us do a little bit, right? So it's really the focus is what you guys do operationally. Obviously, this blends into the franchise world, but Myrna, I guess your team has a little bit of contact with him. But yeah, it's just about the honest truth on everything that we are as a company where we are today. Yeah. That's where the most learning is will come from. Your pain points and what is going wrong and bad, so be honest and open up. Okay. So why don't you introduce yourselves just really, really, really quick and then we'll do the same on our side and then we'll give it to the ne potatoes. Free, please.ar? Go ahead. That's we'll go. You on this one. So, Mike Hanson, I' been in this industry for 25 plus years across multiple brands and operations and different on the vendor side of the equation, so keep it quick. Matt Masteller, 25 years in the industry, mostly back office and systems and processes across finance accounting, you know, IT systems, and, yeah. And these guys have helped multiple franchise based fitness companies get from a fractured model to a more streamlined model where everybody's doing the same thing. Part of the reason we chose these guys was not just the fitness experience of 50 years combined, but the things that they have done in that process as far as getting somebody to a more of a franchise or model. Well, I'mna, I've been with the company for 17 or 18 years. I don't act't even know that number anymore. And I oversee our member service, customer care department, which we serve more as a support for the clubs. for escalations. items that they can't necessarily process themselves, like refunds, credits. We do a lot of compliance auditing as well. So most of what my team does is support the club staff, general managers, and then oversee compliance. I'm Kristen Wheeler. I've been here for 23 years and you've been here 18. 18? Yeah. She's counting. You're five years under me. That's how I know that. Anyways, I do operations for an AMAC office operations, Lost Prevention and Safety facilities falls underneath me. I ultimately oversee Myrna's Department and then central membership advisors. So. Oh, Kevin, director of the PMO. Right now, I'm just kind of sitting in because ultimately, once this project really kicks off and we're in the transition phase, it will end up falling into the PMO. So I'm just trying to get my arms around, sort of how we can best support both the lead up to the transition and the transition itself. Perfect. And is a majority of the work and support on corporate or both corporate en franchisee in this? We only service company owned clubs, and then any franchise that does come through, it's by error or because they're trying to get escalate, you know, from the club level and think we're all one, right? So they're just calling corporate. So we don't service franchisees. They just come in because numbers are trying to find a loop to get a hold of somebody. So we only service company company owned clubs, the 50 that we have. Let's not forget Robbie in with a quick introduction himself in his role. O. Robbie Graham started yesterday, I do what Kristen Says. You see, you can see it's mom of the house over there. You've been here 18 years. I've been here 22, 23 years as well. I'm the senior vice president of Ops. So I'm focused on all of this coming together in a big way. Perfect. Thanks for. Um, something I do want to ask really quick before we start, so you know how you ask together information and did you guys get like the franchisees playbook? Okay. Because Myrna Knight and Robbie, we sat in like hours of meetings with that as well, because a lot of times they will take what we do on the company side and implement that on the franchise side. So I just wanted to make sure that they gave that to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was worth it. And that's the goal of this, right? Some are implementing it, some are not what our goal here is, is that it's not a choice, it's a standard because of the product that we offer, and it's fully encompassing of everything that we do. So, to your point, Kristen, yes, that's what this discovery is about, is so that we can streamline all the processes across, not only the company owned, but the franchise owned g, so that there's continuity with those.. Dallas was that the strong? No. No, that's something. It was I mean, it's, like, it is, like, over Yeah, it's over probably close to 200 pages. It's in the same folder for you guys that I we put it into, but I it is. let me go there. Like, we went through hours of interviews with other consultants, because we paid thousands of dollars for this playbook, for the franchisees to be put together. And this product, yeah. So the work product that set on that is, over the course of many years, we've changed the approach from a business perspective that we're doing primarily due to production, more than it is just operations. and in that production model, many of the franchises have stayed entrenched, and then others have followed us to where it's it's not necessarily a production modeling the same way. And what happens is as those that needed the guidance of the organization that we used to provide in the past that was 100% focused on on production metrics, we recreated that so that we could fill the gaps for those that continued down that path as we continued to go an alternate direction that was a more organic approach to the lead metrics. Gotcha. It's in the franchise documents fer. It's like Section A, section B, section C. Yeah, it was so big that she broke into.. Yeah, because it came over in a file I just. So the difference between that and strong is that's the franchisee playbook and strong is your. Yeah, so strong was rolled out by our district managers on this past year. And it had to do with front desk Metrics, personal training. Go ahead, Robbie. Yeah, I think I think betterter said is that strong is the.. support centers's approach to business today, and will ultimately be the, you know, linked in to the one model that we're looking for. So it's us realigning our business, and ultimately, we will want everyone on it.. And the consultants went out and interviewed all the franchisees to find best in class amongst them. Is that what is? I don't know the franchisees involvement. This was at the support center level.. And's out in, like, the regional levels interviewing people to put the different sections of that playbook together for the franchisees. Yeah, I think my experience is there's a select one or two that really provide data and input. It is not across the board. Yeah, and I think it was more about our franchise team saying, "I need to have some sort of playbook to attract a new franchisees." So they brought in some industry consultants to help put that together, not based on how we were operating in our company gyms, not specific to the way anyone particular franchisee was operating, but just to have something that was a starting point to say, we have something, so we can sell what appears to be a turnkey solution. I believe that that will continue to evolve. Our FBCs have evolved it toward from what the consultants did to what is kind of makes sense for us. And I think that what we've developed with a strong program, those two things combined will eventually become the merge, just like everything else, right? Here's what they do, here's what we do. We got to find this common ground of how we're all going to operate, whether it's a system or an operational playbook. Yeah, and to that point, Ryan, I think that's for existing. I think new, new, you know, we would like to transition that new franchisees are on strictly a strong model operated by the support clubs. I do understand that, you know, in 50 years, there are franchises that we are blending together, so we will start with amended, strong model for those that have been doing business for 20 years a particular way, and we're still supporting. Moving forward, the idea of a one system is that everyone is doing everything exactly the same from the head. Yeah. So that's kind of what we talked about in the prior session with Danny and Brad was, whatever we believe is the best in class working model for a net new franchise, eventually, everyone else should say, yes, that's the best in class, and I want to get there, it's going to take me time because I've got, you know, all this tech debt and years of operational processes and my way of doing things, and we have to figure out how we get there, but we should be able to turn a brand new franchise like that when all of a said and done on this new model tech act a racial process. Sounds good. So on from a corporate perspective, every single corporate club is going through the corporate website? Correct. So there's no one offs out there, like the franchisees. Perfect. So that is one thing that's nice for working on the company's side is we have systems and processes in place, and we all beat to the same drum. Like, there isn't one club doing this, another club working off of this system. So. That's what's nice. Yeah, and everybody's on Moo? Yes. What else do you guys have in your day to day text tech? Um, Demou for personal training and in body. facilities uses service channel. We use qu tricks for our member experience platform. And then we use something called in Touch for our audits. gym audits. Yeah. Anything else I'm missing, Robbie? As far as major platforms moving forward, I don't. ocean vibe. Yeah. For group exercise. Yep. and scheduling. And that. Yep. And that. Insp is CRM fromercid. spot, yep. No, CRM total, not just marketing. Yeah. Okay. And Anything getting there anyway, On the clubs, are they all similar amenity? Like, what's this like, if we' looked at the size of the box and different amenities, they Every club's different. So, for instance, we have out of our 50 clubs, we only have seven that has kids' club. Some clubs have pools, some don't, some sanas, some don't. One club has pickleball, a few clubs have basketball court, so it's across the board.. We have two jails that have outdoor. in the operational, then? Pardon me? A ton of anomalies in the operational support, then. I mean... What? to a degree, but you want to look at this as an acquisition business, so much of the product that we have is based on, like, if you were taking an acquisition program to where you pull together five or six brands and brought them into one, we're going to have product in the field that is very much that, that is 50, $60,000 square foot, and then we're going to have some that was company owned built that's 28,000 square foot. Those amenities will vary within those, along with with the structure within them. We moving forward, we won't be doing our goal is not acquisition, it is built, so the consistency should start at our new model of Burnet, and along with all the renovations and things going forward, but San Antonio was an acquisition. There's probably a third of Austin that's left its acquisition. And so the product is all over. So we got to narrow that scope. Mm. Um, forgive me, Rob. I'm gonna hit the record button that I should have hit 10 minutes ago. It may ask you to agree to be here. You're probably mute you and turn off your camera. Do you agree, seriously? Yeah, just so you know that's coming. Sorry about that. interrupt the flow there. But please come back. He's like, it's like. That's my out.. That's my. Let's see. Okay, I was making sure somebody else didn't have to agree other than Robbie He's on remote. Okay. So what within that text stack, what are some of the existing problems that you have? Or all of them, not some of them. Nobody's perfect, we know that, so.. Man, in my opinion, performanance is gonna be huge, right? We have performance issues with motion soft, and when we look at Bridge, our 50 clubs with another 150 franchisee clubs and then grow to whatever the case may be, it's got to be a performance, you know, a scalable solution from a performance standpoint. No hiccups. How's our downtime? I mean, we know ABC's down a lot. I downtime is I mean, depending on who you've asked, there might be different definitions, but the traditional definition of truly down, I mean, they're a triple nines upime kind of system right 99.9% of time, they're up. It's got performance issues, slowness, where, like somebody just checked in, but it's not even registering for 15 seconds. They already halfway down the hallway, oh, they have a balance, you know, kind of thing. So slowness performance is definitely an issue today. And in that vein, motion soft correct me if I'm wrong, right, but does have some API integration roadblocks, depending on, you know, what we're using. Yeah. What does that mean? Just double clicking on that with the API? Some of it is just limitations and functionality, performance there as well. The way their system works is they built the gym management system and their interface on top of the same APIs that we use. So from at least from a consistency standpoint, the join online that I I do that we built the interface from the website is the same API being called from their MRM if you sold it within the gym management system, right? So there's consistency, but it's also latency as far as it's all getting hit by all the different ways at the same time. Gotcha. You know, one of the things we've recently talked about, not to go too far down a rabbit hole, but just to give you an example is in order to use an API to add a form of payment, like my credit card expired, I need to go, I want to update it, or this card, this compromise, law stolen, so I need to add a new one. The only way you can add a form of payment is to already have that form of payment. So if I'm already with credit card billing, I can go update via API with credit card. If I'm on ACH banking, I can only update my ACH banking so we can't add. The technical reasons are it's a multi agreement system and behind the scenes, your form of paintment can be applied. I can use a credit card for my membership agreement. If I have a recurring PT agreement, I can add a different credit card. So the ability to update a card is only good for what it's currently being used for. So one of the things we're trying to solve for, recently, is how can I take these paid and full memberships that come up for renewal and find a way to automate and have these our CMAs, or centralized salespeople here, send these reminders and notifications, and try to encourage them to renew. A lot of them because they're a PIF, it was a one time payment when they joined, they don't have that car on file. We don't want our CMAs here in house, taking credit cards over the phone, on recorded calls and such, because compliance and PCI things. So the fact that they don't have form of payment already on, we can't just serve up a little form with a link that says, hey, click this link, it'll be a collective data collection form for you to put in your EFT, because it doesn't know how to apply it. So we're trying to these are solves that the current technology just doesn't have solves for we're trying to think outside the box how we can solve with that kind of thing. Tim is central membership advisors, just so you know. Gotcha. Yeah, social salespeople here that work on behalf of all the gems as opposed to being one person in a gym, right? So the renewal situation, you just have them go to the club? Yeah, right now, from historically, most of them have been directed to go to the club to do it an in gym. We're trying to just, you know engage them. sooner better, more often than hope they come into the club and sign up, or here's a call list for the GMs to try to reach out, right? So there's more effective ways and that's, again, the point of this conversation was it's a limitation of the APIs to quickly and easily solve for that. Yeah, In addition to that to his point, just autoator type information to where it's automated, so, you know, if somebody's on ACH and we lose draft, you know, our delinquency or excuse me, our decline rates are you, we can't affect because we can't proactively go after. Right. What is your average default, right? By, what, 7, 8%, Ryan? Yeah, I believe Yeah. Which is fair, probably for industry for what I understand, but, you know, if we can find a half a point here, half a point there, it makes a difference. 'Cause all that's organic. Mm hmm.. And you were saying, Brian, the collections is outsourced? We use a company called All This for third party collections. There is the first 90 days, internal processes that are overseen by our billing department in conjunction with some motion soft resources that kind of do a series of what they call balls. It's emails and calls that are kind of automated in the first 90 days, at the 90 day point, we basically terminate their membership. They go to this A, third party collection. And then they do just direct calls, emails, different various means to reach out to the members for collections. Gotcha. Okay. And then there's a I forget what the split is, but every dollar they recoup, they get a portion of it. And so I'm not sure where our collection rate is or whatever, but yeah, that's kind of just a semi-automated external process at the 90 day mark. Okay. Okay. And then, not to change subjects, but do you use gates for the front desk or entering into the gym, or is it. We have, what, about seven gyms have gates?. Yeah. Right? Yeah. About seven? Yeah, so our newest builds in.. Ad Venice. Yeah. Dallas Market, our Houston Market, Venice,, John Reed, different brand, but, again, we need to make sure we're solving for John Reed as well. Operations should be consistent, so it's really just a different naming standard, but as we move off of motion soft, we don't want to live with just those four John Reed clubs in that world and support multiple systems. So everybody comes to the party, basically when the time comes to make the shift, so that would be John Reed and Jaim Matt as well. Okay. I think Robbie, what would you say, unless the gates situation improves, that's not probably going to be our model going forward or TBD? That's difficult, because I would think that Ryan in the years to come, the technology, you know, issues that they're have and should go away, right? It should be should be easier and easier for them to work, because it's on them. They're the reason that we're not doing it. We would prefer it. So the answer right now is no. We do not anticipate to grow with gates, but if the providers and vendors could get it together, then it would be an avenue I'd prefer. Yeah, the world we live in today, it's a good, bad and ugly, this is the ugly. The only integration that motion soft has is with the Gannner gay control device. We use a company called Vonle for the actual physical gates because Germany thought they were pretty and it's a German company, probably. But regardless of the physical gait, the control mechanism that says, is this barcode allowed yes or no that can communicate with motion solve? The only integration they have is with gander. So as we look at all these other systems, we do want to understand what that looks like, because that will impact the clubs that we have, that has it, it'll impact several other franchise gyms that do also have it and have 24 hour operational processes more like at any time fitness, where it is a come and go and they need access control. So just to be clear so that we're all on the same page, the gem that we just finished building, I entrenched and put in the ability to add gates later, but we did not start with them because of this roadblock. So I'm definitely not saying no, but it has to be a turnkey solution. Right, yeah. If the technology is solid, you would want them. Yes, sir. Okay. And then, so are most clubs or how many clubs are open 24/7 on average, like, a percentage? Is it? A third. A third? And is that, like the model of the future, 24/7 or. More, no, no. It will be unique to the demographics. Okay. Yeah. So, if a. Okay. So, probably, what, younger demographics or.. Well, yeah, younger downtown and medical centers, things like that nature. it lends towards a 24 hour, where the suburban areas do not. Robin, you said a third? From a company I'm gonna say a third, because it's somewhere between 6 and and 12 ultimately wherever we land. And I'm just roughly using that number because I also, obviously we're all in one room together that we don't repeat things. I don't know what our headcount looks like in the future either. I don't know that we will be more efficient at what we do with a smaller number and provide a true franchising business that is consistency, or I don't know if we're going to get to the point to where we're trying to grow locations again. What I do understand in this 20 years of operating this business is, this business is not scalable enough for us to own 150 gms as we did in the past, and have a one system, because demographically, not all 150 are going to be successful, and that hinders your ability to sell franchises. Okay. So there is a sweet spot we haven't found it. And when you think about it, not many franchise businesses are owning their own and providing their own proof of concept in magnitude. It is it is a very small number, and there's a reason for that. So we have to understand what we're doing moving forward, and we just don't know that yet. Mm mm, mm. Another system we use that does tie into most, and we only have it in one of ourins, but it's called towel tracker. Yeah. So. That's a good one. Yeah. And I think at the end of the day, any amenity that, you know, we're trying not to hinder or limit the ability for a franchise to run their business and what makes sense in their particular market. So if they want to introduce a towel Tracker service, where you can basically artFID, check out towels with the barcode scan, we have wellness equipment that also has an integration with Mosso at Arberna Club where you can scan your Marco to understand that you have that amenity in service and basically kick in the machines to work. We want those types of integrations, whether it's a scan de seed, you have general access, because they've chosen a door control door access system, whether it's access to a particular room because Pilates is an upsell at they're particular gym and it's considered an amenity, and it's a if you pay, you get access, recovery, rooms with massage chairs, cryo chairs, whatever the case may be, any sort of amenity should be able to say, if you have it as part of your membership, a barcode scan can tell you you have that in grant access to that amenity. Okay, okay. In that way, it opens the ability for the Don Murphys, who have a swim program to allow access to the pool area, or, you know, he's introducing batting cages in the golf swing digital stuff as part of his, you, amenities at his, it's separate LLCs from a business standpoint, but he's allowing you to say, you can upgrade your membership for an all inclusiveness because it's it's kind of compartmentalized in this mall area with his gym. So we'll have to understand, you know, some of these anomaly franchisees, but at the end of the day, who knows what the next amenity is going to be, you know, you know, right now, wellness is huge, with recovery, those kind of things. Two or three years from now, what's the next trend that allows the need to say, integrate with this system for X, Y, Z reasons? So we just need that future proofing via API primarily, I think is what it boils down to. Mm hmm. We didn't talk yet about, we just rolled out, "H Libby, which is now repifying, which is our AI concierge's phon answering, the benefits there, right, is to single call resolution to the callers that may have to spaceic questions or routing nonmember calls to a local gym staff and or providing them with a text link of our join align and or our free pass link, you, via text, if for some reason there wasn't a live person to talk to or you opted out of talking to a live person. If you are a member, then rats to Mr's team through or the system that we had before, where you could pick for billing or cancellation or the stuff, the other kind of stuff. So we just rolled that out and that's part of our tech stack. It is right now it's independent, right it doesn't really require, you know, drug integration independent in our phone system. It may or may not be our choice for the future, but it's something that we're definitely trying now to impact operations in production, you Robbie and the Krist benefit. Yeah, and we're using it.. Go ahead, Robbie. We will offer in our one model, AI assistance and phone service. So, I mean, it's just a block we need to add in there. Yeah. I mean, you can't call anywhere in the world without getting it these days. We have to provide it to our franchises. Yeah, and I think where we go is we look at agentic AI, just, in general, right? I mean, there's AI agents that do everything from back off as functions and automations to direct member interactions, to in gym benefits for a general manager to automate processes. I mean, it's the way we're moving, and so we need to look at all different agent type components in what they might offer the business, be it That's member facing, back office, B to B, whatever case may be.. So another thing, and Robbie, we don't have a status yet. He's going to check on this, but another thing that we are working on digital marketing is rolling out is called Talon one. And it's to send out, be able to send out promo codes to prospects that expire after a certain time. Let's just say we have a special offer that we're sending out. So that will be go ahead. That's really an add on, So the promo codes actually come from us. Tell them one is an add on that gives it an expiration, so tell them one is an add on. So it may or may not be part of this discussion. I think the larger function is part of the discussion and how we do it, maybe becomes secondary, because talent one is also a function that provides gamification, it provides data management for referral source so that it can then go back and go into your operating system. So for instance, Talon one can be an add on to the app, which manages the data bucket of referrals to which then it can API into motion soft, to understand how many times that referral has actually been built, so then we can pay the referral, you know, bonus to the referring member. So it's an add on more than anything. Has that that digital marketing the kind of manage that? Okay, I. You are those that are working on it. Yeah, we'll have to ask them a little more about that. Yeah. Because the future may be that we have a fully encompassing system and we're not buying add-ons toVs is the reason I say what I say. Yeah, I think the the key there in them mentioning it is referrals is a big thing for us, right? And we want to reward the referrer. On the referree, you, has reached a certain milestone, either a membership payments or activity have you. If there's an operational process that we believe is best in practice that's going to generate sales or revenue, regardless of the technology we use today, we're not today, or the technology we'll use in the future, it's more about this is the process and the play that we think we're going to run. And whether the text act of the future saw us for it inherently natively as part of it, or it has to be an external service, all those are TVD based on all these discoveries. So we don't necessarily, I mean, it's easy to say, oh, yeah, there's this system and it does X,YZ, but we need to think of it as, what's the process to get to the solution for the future? Right. So anything process that is either manual automated or just something we want to do or should be doing or are doing is what we want to try to get the most out of in this conversation. Yeah, and probably the category of that is if we move back to our billing, what's archaic for is our billing, so our billing should should be built in a way or have a stack that allows us to be able to monitor and manage, decline rates, reengagement of expirations, follow ups, the It is completely organic now, the loss or termination of a member based on their financials, whether they pay, don't pay, expire, don'tpire, change payment, or whatever, that should be taken care of, and from a franchise perspective, that would be one of the more valuable ads for them. I mean, y'all talked to enough fitness people, and y'all have been in the business now for a while. Everybody talks about money going out of the back end as a can you get me a few percent out of that?" And that's always been the question. And if you have found a way to do that, enlighten us, and if you haven't, we got to just be better at what we do. Okay. You know. What about I just when we have different promos for different clubs, right? Or for whatever, or we change a promo, is there an issue at all with the fact that it's pretty much a manual process now? I heard Kim talking about how last night or on Sunday, she's up until midnight to click send on the new like, is that a pain point for operations that there's no automated way to set and schedule something and therefore there's more points of breakage in that problem. It is, but I think that, you know, the conversations I've had with Alex is this is probably another add on at the moment so that the website can have an add on to where we can set up automations and schedule things out to happen automatically. Um, I don't believe it's that we need a new we. We do need a new website, obviously, but I don't think that's the answer at the moment. Okay. Is that the way you? It's a question for, but even on the side, it's more on our side. I mean, at the end of the day, whatever operations decides this is the play for the week or the month or whatever, it's got to be created, those bundles or agreements had to be created in the system. The problem with the current website is she has to say, hey, website team, I've created these two new bundles, switch it out, so that's what you're offering. Okay. And, you know, while she is willing to get up at midnight, the other team is like getting to it at 9 or 10 a.m. That's the problem. That's what I feel like there's too many breakage points. When we build But again, but high level, Ryan, that's an add-on to the website to create automation more than it is anything... That was an oversight of that. Like the direct bill side of the house. If Tracy goes and her team goes and adds five new bundles for X, Y,Z, direct bill companies, they just they show up, they get pulled, right? There's not as much. I mean, there's still some pieces you have to do in the portal, but it's designed to say, whatever is out there, I serve it up. Okay. And in the way motion soft works is you can flag them to say, this is an engine offering an online, so we can distinguish clearly what the API should pull in. These are only online offers, engine or both, and whatever you can even future schedule up to where the start date is, you know, 000 hours tomorrow, Kim can configure today, and ideally, the website should be able to just say, what's available now, these plans, Boom, we hit tomorrow, midnight, boom, now, these are available. Okay. Pulls directly from. But that's on the website side as far as... It's also a Moso limitation, right? I mean, it's. No, Moso has the ability to manage that, identify online plans versus in gym offers, so you're not offering up. schedule it as well.. Keep your scheduled, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's a website issue. It stinks. Okay. Oh, I mean, either way, that's an important thing that you would want in this current, like.. if you're looking, not from the website, but I'm saying you wouldn't want to lose the ability. You can think you're in schedule on our side because you get a point. We're going to need an add on in some way so that the website can accomplish it because it is structurally the website cannot do it, so that's what I meant by. We have to find that gap. Mm hmm. F fair enough, yeah. Yeah, the business problem is the scheduling and the automation of new promos to come online when we want them to if that's the business problem. Yeah, yeah.. So it doesn't pull directly from Moso. The website today. The website team has to, you know, update a CMS or something like that. But as we evaluate, what is the gym management system of the future to your point, yes, we want to check that box that the ability to be able to say on a 3 o'clock, on a Friday configure the plan for the the holiday weekend, so somebody's not getting up at 2 a.m. on a Saturday morning to set it up, right there's And most of those are that way these days. Yeah, and there's pulling the offers from the system of record, but then there's also, if there's any calls to action or anything like that, that needs to come up on the website, you know? Yeah. Okay. So again, the where we live in, the systematically motion sol does it. website is broken. We pick another Jim management system and move to it. The website's still going to be broken. Some of them. embedded widgets that you put in the website where the website doesn't have to be coded to make the call, the embed widget is simply the avenue from the core system, and it presents it according to the configuration in the back office of that system. So really, it's a technology hurdle for us today, but it's a business process that we want to keep high level in offices, I think is the point in the conversation. The p point isn't an internally owned pain point, because we own the development of the website. Right. So it sounds like operations works closely with digital marketing and the website team to kind of make this happen. Yeah. Mm hmm. Okay, painfully. I mean, it's painfully imprecise that, you know, you're hearing it around the table. Yes, may no touch points that aren't necessary.. What else do you guys have in operations that is manual and painful and your vision is things are better or, you know, just all these guys understand? day day. I would say our cancellation website are internal, cancellation website that we have club staff used to enter cancellations. It was created initially to be member facing, but then we pulled that, and so now it's just club personnel use it. for a way to automatically process a cancellation versus processing it manually in motion soft. The pain point for us is constantly having to come up with workarounds because the API does not work as it was designed, whether it's from what we built on the cancellation website or because Moso API is not working as it should. So it's still, it always comes down for us internally. technology in general is just a p point. That would be the biggest one because it also affects the gyms, you know, GMs are having to take extra time to process a cancellation that we designed this website so that you don't have to spend so much time on processing a cancellation, Yeah, Robbie, do you do you ever see a day where either the technology is better to help them move through the cancellation process or we just trust our GMs enough to say, I can actually look in your membership and say, you're an obligation for two more months, therefore, your cancellation date would be February 15th because you're on the 15th bill cycle. We have a website that we to Mer's pointoint, that we built that has this logic behind the scenes that says, you're in obligation to figure out when the earliest, they can cancel.You're out of obligation, but you have to give a 30 day notice. So add 30 days, what's the next closest billing cycle of yours? Because if I cancel early, then I got to do a refund. So the way it works is on the day of the However, when we get away from motion solve, that will change. promotions. But that needs to go away. Yeah, like when we have it's also dependent on the agreement. So right now we have a promotion where members don't pay dues until next year, January. So two months recing. I'm not a tech guy. I just listen to y'all say things. So I believe the issue is. each agreement being independent that we would need something intuitive enough, that it could understand the agreements and individually assign a cancellation path based on an agreement. And I think that's too complex in the world we're in today. Therefore, are roadblocks are, we do it manual. Well, but not necessarily, because we even as introducing new agreements, again, the limitation with Moso and then talking to you know, talking to Bonu's data tables or whatever. It's just the technology is not it's not working as it's supposed to and it's just too much time to spend on troubleshooting because it's a short- term problem. By January, we won't have this problem anymore because the no dos until January is done with. So they'll recreate on the next promo. My point is, we don't have something that can identify the agreement terms in order to set the cancellation path. Clearly, yeah. Clearly. Whether it's a human that can say, oh, I can walk into a gym in a general manager doesn't have to know calculus to figure out when they're going to cancel, or we don't have to write all this complex behind the scenes logic, to try to interpret all of our business rules, right? Some of it is self inflicted gunshot wounds, basically, where we've overcomplicated our business, but we can't rewind and go back to the past until those members that are active cancel, we have to live with the rules that we made of the past, even if we simplified everything tomorrow as, you can cancel immediately. It doesn't change the past, right? So we still have to solve for it again, to your point. I think some of it's most of limitations, some of it is the fact that, you know, as people come up with new creative ideas, we have to code for it to accommodate it. And we should be forward thinking to say, whatever the new system is, we have to be able to accommodate our old business rules and make sure that we're not also creating more problems for the future. And are these things automatable or or not? Are they simple enough for our staff? Are there new AI tools, they That's it, there are that can interpret what it should be and do the logic and the math for you without it being, you know, all the craziness that we've had to write. So what's our vision? Is our vision, simplicity and cancellation? Are we going to be that brand that makes it? Well, I think the question, yeah, I think the question is, do we see we still want to own the cancellation process and have a certain amount of back office control, John Reed, because the newness of the brand, a little bit more simplicity in the agreents that were set up, but like, we don't do those through the website, right? Through our homegrown back office website, that the Gold G's GMs. You walk into the gym and they have full rights with their login, for the GM to say, "I'm going to cancel you." and maybe some autonomy to even say, "I'm going to bypass the normal cancellation because I have that authority, cancel you immediately versus the end of obligation. I don't know if they have all this.. I think the real answer is there needs to be AI learnings in a way that they can decip each agreement and set that individual based on their own cancellation path automatically, and then manually GMs have override rights. So it should be 1% that the GM is doing a special and they should have, you know, authorization to override, but everyone else should be click and play and Rick, we it's not that we want to take the path of simplicity in the future. We should be there now. We do not want to be an organization that anyone ever says again, I tried to cancel and I couldn't. That's got to be an outright life.". Actually, I think legally, you'll need to comply, so there's these click to cancel rules that are already we've already impled that. Yeah. Yeah.. So you' And I'm just reinforcing that. Rumor is also a business, let's or something like that.. But it'll happen, right? Yeah, To that note, the law states that it needs to be just as easy to cancel as it was to sign up. So we offer the ability for a member to input their information to say, I gave you my information. You the back. Yeah, behind the scenes, it's still a manual process. It's not fully automated. And some of that's operational where we still want a touch point. There's nothing that says you legally can't reach out them and say, hey, here's all the reasons why you shouldn't cancel. I'm want to try to save you. But at the end of the day if you still want to cancel, we'll cancel you. You know, our first experience of a direct member online portal for cancellation for five, six years ago, whenever it was, seven years ago, ramped up too many cancellations too fast. So we want a little bit of speed bump in there, little bit despite the FTC rolls of the ease of submitting the cancellation. Right, uh. And motion soft, how are they reacting to the click to cancel? Are they providing the APIs? They don't really provide anything from an interface standpoint. They're still action required by our staff. Gotcha. So what happens is the gym gets the request when the member does it. The gym gets the request and they still have to go through this internal cancellation website and submit the request. And then the API, if it's, you know, works, then it'll process it. Otherwise, the gym will then send us an email to process manually. Yeah. And back to the fractured world that we live in, the website, one of the few things that is designed to be all company, Since you signed up from the website, despite it going to this ABC platform and signing you up, the member just knows, I signed up for Go's Gym. I need to be able to cancel just as easily from Go's Gym. So you go to that website, you pick the gym in which you cancel, it now knows, oh, yeah, that's this ABC gym over here, sends that information to whatever point of contact was defined for that particular gym, and then they have to pick it up from there and go and process the cancellation of their system. So we want to get to a point where either we decide there's full automation or maybe there's still some roadblocks to try to save before, but the cemental process needs to be universal and ideally, it needs to be more automated in its downstream approaches. Yeah, and I think we just go for a full automation and then we can insert human elements that can override later with save offers and things of that nature, and that'll be the safest play. Yeah. Okay. So do you do you manage the staff inside the clubs end, too? Is that covered? Okay, so that's different. managers are oversaw by the district managers. Which we have three of them that are. There are OM in the club? Operations Managers in the club or No, it's the general manager and then the assistant general manager. Okay. So those are the two heads of the club. And then above them is the district manager. We have three regions. And we used to have operations managers. We morp that model to mor streamlined. So the GMs and AGMs are probably correct me if I'm wrong, but they have those OM type responsibilities as well, right? So Yes, and we get confused because in the past, our GM was our primary salesperson. Today, our GM is our primary operations person. So there, I don't want to look at it as there's GM operations managers. There are two managers of the club, and they are responsible for operations. They are responsible for production. They're responsible for the whole nine yards. Okay. Okay. Models today don't allow the overhead of the past.. You know, gone are the days of four offices of managers and seven offices of salespeople that that overhead is murdering all margins in every fitness business. So that's why it's narrowed down to a more simplified approach. Okay. And then, yeah, no, no dealing with franchisees or franchise clubs. It's just corporate. Okay. How much, do you guys cover off on our fitness and personal training, endeavors? Or should we just be covering that with Alex and the team from Fitness when they come in and talk to us, you know, I guess the big thing as the members on boarded, who do they talk to in order to have maybe a free session with training or an assessment and then getting to the the path of personal training sales? I think you're getting into operational task more than you are system on that one, Rick. I think more of what we need to be focused on when it comes to fitness is that all of our systems work together well in provide any automations that we're looking for. you know, such as can scheduling appointments and things of that in nature integrate into website or app or things of those. But as far as process that you're mentioning, that should stay in house. Yeah, certainly, I was just looking to see if you guys had current systems in place, or you wanted to talk about any pain points in that kind of onboarding attracting a choir, and then the engagement part, you know, towards, you know, personal training. is that is that a focus? Is that a current pain point? Do you guys feel like? It is, but it's it's difficult to say because we are finishing this CRM platform, which will do a lot of that for us. In the next few weeks, we should have that fully built. Along with the CRM platform, then we start our integrations. We have to bring our phones, our texts, our digital movement assessments, our inbodies, all of those in so we have a centralized place to be able to manage it appropriately. So more of the question is, can all the data end up in one spot for ease of management than it is actual process? 'Cause the process is fine. Is Hub spot the CR that you're speaking of? Yes.. what we do is another follow up to that particular is that specific text Act, or we can get a little bit of an explanation from Alex when Fitness comes in, you know, around that. If you guys need, you, that mapapped earlier rather than later. Yeah, and I mean, hub Spot's a big app. It's like, whathat are you using? What parts of Hubsw are you using? There's a lot of different, you know, nooks and crannies inside of hubspots. So if that would be good to double double click on and So we need to build it in an efficient way because we were just starting. So to answer your question, we own the marketing and sales modules, the marketing module is used at 10 or 15% and the sales module is being built as we speak. So the learnings that you have are probably going to be the most important to us, because, yes, it is a broad platform that we don't necessarily have an expert in. Okay. Me and you guys are obviously all leveraging Dot 2 in body as components of systems, right, in order to get information on the potential personal training client andor, convert that client into programming and things of that nature, right? Correct. Yep. So I had a question, but it might be for him. So, from your guys's viewpoint, Jim of the future, ground up build, what's in it? What's That's gonna be a question. What's the, uh, what's the amenities that are the most profitable, that's sort of like, what's the gym bag? All right, I got a question for you. So, you're building a new gym in the future here, and you get to decide what amenities going to, what's the gym in the future look like to you for gold? Um, We have we have one of those that we can show to you and it pretty much has all that in the Austin area. The amenities are very narrowed compared to our current product. When you talk about true amenities, it will be nothing more than at the moment recovery, towel service. Um, you know, if you want to don't think we're going into saunas and things like that as amenities, 'cause that's standard, but recovery and towel service at the moment are the only two amenities in our narrowed down version. Does the new amenity have just all fitness? Right now. That's TBD. Yeah. And so, Austin is the flagship there. What are the other Yeah, Austin Barnett Road is the is the latest model we've built, yes. How big is that location? Uh, I want to sit... I Let's just put it down at 30. Um, it might be slightly. It might be 29 something, to be exact. Okay. And then another question that just love to hear you guys, this perspective, um, ideal dashboard, KPIs, that you're looking at at a higher level. Obviously, there's drill down, but what are you looking at? I mean, depending on where you want to start, if we're starting at the top, it's a member count, it's a doos line, um, those types of high level revenue metrics. as it goes from there, obviously people can just break it to the ridiculous, but I think from an executive level, the most important thing is top line cash, on those. Okay. Shane, Shane confirmed $27,000 square feet. Yeah, okay. That's what we ended up with after the office space was gone. Okay. Yeah. Uh, three minutes to go. Anything else? Did you guys want to highlight or bring to attention or. Nope.. No, KPIs you can think of just from a member of services standpoint? No. In qu tricks, we have, member experience, KPIs, regarding friendliness, cleanliness, and a promoter score. And franchise does go ahead. We have all KPIs. They're just not all in the same place, so I think as with everything else, it's more about just pulling them into a one stop dashboard. Currently, there is no data that we need to add. So, franchise and Company, we all run on qual tricks. So that is the one system we're consistent with. Gotcha. NPS is kind of like the Holy Grail. Major, yeah.. Yeah. Some believe in it, some don't. I got a real nice presentation last week when I was at the NBC presentation. Kelly did a great job. Yeah, Kelly does a good job. She was phenomenal. Of course, she's like, "Hey, Rick, I need more data." and I'm like, " okay. Let me pull it out of my pocket here." I understand that yourvision for the future. Oh, one of the things, and this is going to be a hollow conversation, we'll probably just need to bring a Danny and Brad into this, but when we really start looking at company owned dashboards and we talk about a one system, it really should make the transparency of the franchise revenues for us a bit easier. That is probably the number one need. If I were to say there's a number one need, it's complete transparency into cash flow with the the franchises. Now, that's, again, how we nail that down and exactly how we're looking at it is a conversation for them two to be involved, but. that's the only need from a global company perspective. Yeah, and you'll get when we do the building one, you'll get insights onto Tracy and her team and where they she builds franchisees, licensing, GVP, all the different areas of our business, so she's all things. her team is all things billing. And what you'll understand, and I think I mentioned is, we've got Eduardo, I think, in one of the calls as well, the fact that there's a monthly interaction of someone on the franchising team coming in and say, wait, building is not a pull the trigger and Bill, based on what they reported, there's all these exceptions of, for this particular franchise, don't do this. We gave Among Jordan a reprieve on this, and don't do like, there's so many anomalies to just being a systematic building that is crazy. And we're not going into international day one, but even in the domestic world, there's exceptions as well that just don't make a lot of sense. It should be, you know, a lot more standardized than it is. Yeah.. Underst. A lot of those to come through with COVID or something like that. Some of it, yeah, some of it's still some, you know, some. Promissory notes from COVID days in construction that have led to, you know, delayed buildings in, oh, you have this, you can pay over time, but there's interest in fees and such or whatever. But like, typically, billings should be a more automated fashion than it is even on the franchise side. And that one system, you know, again, this is another conversation, but that one system has to be built in a way that we can require new franchises to use it for input, because it's a manually self reported number. And we need to get away from the days of them deciding that how much they're gonna tell us they made. So do you have access to their club management system, so you can at least audit or anything? In the FDD, there is language that says our FBCs in the franchise team have the rights to go in and do audits and they do periodic audits, but it's only as good as what can be exposed to you. There isn't an audit does not mean, you know, like a game warden that pretty much has carte blanche to do whatever the hell they want more so that the average police officer. into their all their locations. Yeah. I mean, it answers, you know. The answer no. Yeah, I mean, the answer for tax records, right, as part of the audit. So if you're reporting this revenue, but your taxes are here, you're either lying on your taxes, too, or you can be caught., you know, somewhat simply by saying, your revenues don't match what you're reporting to the IRS. All right? Yeah. We would want a one system that makes revenues transparent in a way that royalties are facts. Yeah, right. Not to mention the same way in our company gyms, where we kind of do rack and stack, right? Like, these gyms are kicking ass, these top ten bottom ten, right? We want similar abilities to say, why are these franchisees dominating? These guys suck. We either need to get in there and help them. for the sake of the brand, because they're not doing something right. You know, there's all the reasons where we need insight, right? Well, the FBC's. Money is one of them for the franchise community. They kind of do their own, but it's all manual, you, data, whatever. All right, I think we need to wrap up. People needs to pop in. All right. Thank you. Thanks you guys. Thank you guys. Nice to you. Thank you. Thanks, Robbie. Hey, thanks, guys. Thanks, Robbie, Robbie. Don' be more of it. Hey, R. Or Ryan. Y'all mentioned Alex for Fitness.. I want him to discuss with you, but keep in mind, he's two weeks into his position. All of his direction is coming from me. If y'all have major questions that give direction, please circle back to me on that just because it's not his fault that he's learning. Okay, do you want to be added to it that session? I. No, I don't want to be, but I probably should be, yes. Okay. All right. We'll send the invite if you have the time in the ability to make it. If not, we get it, he'll take questions back to you. Cool. Got it. Hey, thanks, guys. Thank you. Thanks for Robbie. All right. It's Billy. Is it Mill in the office? Yeah, I want her know that well, it says a large conference room, right? Yeah, when she started the teams.
