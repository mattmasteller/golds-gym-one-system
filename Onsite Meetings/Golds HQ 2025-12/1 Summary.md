# Gold's Gym HQ Meeting Summary: Technology & Business Assessment

**Date:** December 9-10, 2025
**Location:** Gold's Gym HQ, Dallas/Irving, TX
**Prepared by:** StackHack Labs LLC

---

## Executive Overview

Based on two days of meetings with 8 departments (Executive/co-CEOs, Operations, IT, Billing/Finance, Digital Marketing, Marketing, Fitness, and Franchising), Gold's Gym is at a critical inflection point. The company is shifting from a corporate-gym-focused model to a **franchise-growth-driven strategy** over the next 3-5 years. The core challenge is that their technology infrastructure is fragmented, manual, and incapable of supporting a scalable franchise model.

---

## Strategic North Star (from Executive Meeting)

**Key Strategic Direction:**

- **Corporate gyms stay steady** (~50 locations) - exit underperforming, may opportunistically acquire
- **Franchise growth is the focus** - target 16-25 new franchise gyms per year
- **Goal**: Develop a **"best-in-class franchise playbook"** to attract tier-one franchisee candidates (investment groups, multi-unit operators)
- **Brand positioning**: Return to **strength and performance** DNA - not "everything for everyone"

**Brad (co-CEO) Quote**: *"Three years from now, we want to have a much better traditional franchiser playbook to deploy to franchisees... if we're gonna get real blue chip franchise candidates to come into this brand, we have to offer what would be considered table stakes."*

---

## The "Gym of the Future" Model

From Executive and Franchising meetings, the future Gold's Gym template:

| Attribute | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Size** | 25,000-35,000 sq ft sweet spot |
| **Staffing** | GM + AGM only (lean model) |
| **Sales Model** | Tech-forward, self-service, online sign-ups |
| **Amenities** | Strength/performance focus, recovery rooms - NO pools, limited group X |
| **Access** | QR codes, gates (when tech works), 24/7 for some markets |
| **Pricing** | Elevated pricing ($55-70+) vs. HVLP competitors |
| **Example** | Thornton (CO) and Burnett Road (Austin) as templates |

---

## Current Technology Landscape: Pain Points

### 1. Fragmented Core Systems

| Corporate | Franchise |
|-----------|-----------|
| Motionsoft | ABC (80%+), Peak, Zenoti, others |
| HubSpot CRM | Various (ClubReady, Glean Tap, Gmail) |
| Central website/Joint Online | Own websites (90%+) |
| Motion Vibe app | 20-30+ different Gold's apps published |

**Key Problem**: No unified data lake, no centralized member database, no ability to see franchise revenues or operations in real-time.

### 2. Manual & Unsustainable Processes

| Area | Pain Point |
|------|------------|
| **Promo/Pricing Changes** | Kim (1 person) manually configures 48 clubs, Friday 4pm fire drills for weekend sales |
| **Franchise Billing** | Manual spreadsheets, chase payments, exceptions for every franchise |
| **Join Online Integration** | 3-week process per franchisee, 24 groups backlogged, not scalable |
| **Cancellation Processing** | Complex logic, manual workarounds, APIs unreliable |
| **PT Booking** | Can't book/alter sessions remotely - must be in-gym on network |

### 3. No Visibility or Attribution

- Can't track member journey from ad click to in-gym conversion
- No centralized reporting on franchise performance
- CAC ranges $88-$125 (industry benchmark should be $60-70)
- No SMS follow-up capability (legal blocked it)
- No CDP in place

### 4. Franchisee Autonomy Creates Chaos

- Everyone names fees differently ("annual fee" vs "yearly maintenance fee")
- Different billing cycles, cancellation rules, membership structures
- ABC has a "playbook of rules per franchisee" for their support team
- No standardized GL structure for financial reporting

---

## Common Themes Across All Departments

### Theme 1: "We're Not Best in Class"

Every department acknowledged Gold's lacks the technology infrastructure expected by sophisticated franchise candidates. Competitors (Crunch, Anytime, Planet) have better playbooks.

### Theme 2: Need for Normalization

The #1 technical requirement: standardize naming conventions, GL structures, membership configurations, and processes before any system can work at scale.

### Theme 3: Don't Want to Build a Call Center

Brad was clear: they want an **asset-light model** with minimal headcount growth. Technology must enable self-service and automation, not large support teams.

### Theme 4: Franchisees Must See Value (Not Mandates)

Change management will be the hardest part. Long-standing franchisees are skeptical of corporate initiatives. The new system must be so compelling they experience FOMO.

**Kevin (VP Franchising) Quote**: *"We've been talking about this for four years now... If we wait two years, they're going to be like, 'We're just going to keep doing our own thing because you guys can't deliver on anything.'"*

### Theme 5: Website & App as Quick Wins

Joint Online and the new Mobile App are seen as near-term opportunities to build trust and demonstrate value to franchisees before the full system migration.

---

## Quick Wins to Consider

| Quick Win | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Standardize GL/Chart of Accounts** | Foundation for any unified reporting |
| **Complete Join Online rollout** | Currently 24 franchise groups backlogged |
| **Enable PT booking in app** | Currently can't book remotely - major pain point |
| **Implement global travel pass system** | No reciprocity tracking today (still using paper cards!) |
| **SMS opt-in compliance solution** | Currently blocked by legal - huge conversion barrier |
| **Automate promo scheduling** | Website requires manual updates - constant errors |

---

## Key Non-Negotiables Identified

From various departments, the new system must have:

1. **Brand-level controls** - push configurations once, apply to all
2. **Franchise segmentation** - each owner manages only their gyms
3. **Flexible banking** - multiple bank accounts/processors supported
4. **API-first architecture** - integrate with gates, towel trackers, InBody, etc.
5. **Configurable permissions** - roles/rights by location and job function
6. **Real-time revenue visibility** - royalty calculations based on facts, not self-reporting
7. **Member reciprocity** - check-ins across domestic network with proper tracking
8. **Sales tax handling** - state/city level variations
9. **Motion Vibe integration** - group exercise scheduling is mission-critical

---

## Revenue Opportunity

From Franchising meeting: **Gold's currently collects $0 in technology fees or rebates from franchisees**. Competitors like Crunch charge:

- $5 per joint online
- Percentage of billing as rebate
- Tech fees built into franchise agreements

This could fund the support infrastructure needed without building massive teams.

---

## Recommended Focus Areas for Future Tech Stack

### Priority 1: Core Gym Management Platform Selection

Must support multi-tenant franchise model with brand controls, not just single-operator features.

### Priority 2: Data Normalization & CDP

Before anything else works, data must be clean, consistent, and centralized.

### Priority 3: Member-Facing Digital Experience

- Unified website with automated promo scheduling
- Single app for all domestic members
- Joint Online that scales without 3-week per-franchise implementations

### Priority 4: Franchise Operations Support Model

Decide the boundary: What does Gold's do vs. what franchisees do themselves vs. what the vendor does. Can't be ambiguous.

### Priority 5: Global Reciprocity Platform

Simple lookup system that sits above disparate POS systems for international/domestic travel passes.

---

## Department-Specific Highlights

### Executive (Brad & Danny, co-CEOs)

- Clear on franchise-first strategy
- Want asset-light operational model
- Expect technology to enable, not burden
- Open to consulting help through discovery and design phases

### Operations (Robbie)

- Manages 48 corporate clubs with 1 configuration specialist (Kim)
- Manual processes everywhere - cancellations, promos, reporting
- Desperately needs automation and scheduling tools
- Pain point: can't schedule promotions in advance

### Billing & Finance (Melody & team)

- Manual franchise billing via spreadsheets
- No visibility into franchise revenues before royalty calculation
- Chasing payments constantly
- Want automated reconciliation and reporting

### Digital Marketing (Alex & team)

- 90%+ franchisees have their own websites
- 20-30+ different Gold's apps in app stores
- Joint Online backlog of 24 franchise groups
- CDP planned for 2026 but data normalization needed first

### Marketing (Jake)

- CAC too high ($88-125 vs. $60-70 benchmark)
- No SMS capability (legal blocked it)
- Can't track member journey end-to-end
- No affiliate/referral tracking capability

### Fitness (Erin & Alexander)

- Motion Vibe is critical for group exercise operations
- PT booking can't be done remotely (must be in-gym)
- [Demotu](https://www.demotuapp.com/) being evaluated for movement assessments
- Club Connect used for certifications

### Franchising (Kevin & Katie)

- 150+ domestic franchise locations
- Growth target: 16-25 new gyms/year
- Need compelling playbook to attract tier-one candidates
- Currently collect $0 in tech fees (competitors charge $5+ per transaction)

---

## Risk Factors

1. **Franchisee Resistance**: Long-time operators are skeptical of corporate mandates
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Kevin says 2 more years of inaction will lose credibility permanently
3. **ABC Relationship**: 80%+ of franchisees are on ABC - any migration is complex
4. **International Complexity**: RSG Germany still owns brand; coordination required
5. **Resource Constraints**: Small corporate team, can't build large support infrastructure

---

## Conclusion

Gold's Gym is a storied brand with clear strategic intent but hamstrung by legacy technology, manual processes, and a fragmented franchise ecosystem. The opportunity is significant: with 150+ domestic franchises moving toward one system, plus international partners, and a renewed focus on strength/performance positioning, the right technology foundation could:

1. **Attract tier-one franchise investors** who expect turnkey operations
2. **Create new revenue streams** through tech fees and billing rebates
3. **Improve member experience** with unified digital touchpoints
4. **Reduce operational overhead** through automation
5. **Enable data-driven decisions** with real-time visibility

The urgency is real: franchisees are restless, competitors are advancing, and the window to establish credibility through successful execution is narrow.
