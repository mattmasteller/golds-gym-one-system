**GOLDS IT Department 2025-12-10**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Challenges in Offer Tracking and Franchise Collaboration:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed significant challenges in tracking offers, measuring success, and collaborating with franchisees, highlighting the lack of systemization and visibility that impedes national-scale initiatives and effective partnerships with brands and agencies such as W Promote.

- - **Offer Tracking Limitations:** Teams Hub 1 explained that there is no effective methodology to track member engagement with offers, such as referral systems or affiliate programs, which restricts the ability to scale initiatives nationally and prevents partnerships with large brands from being executed efficiently.
    - **Franchisee Visibility Issues:** The group noted that franchisees often lack clarity on what constitutes success, leading to inconsistent execution and a 'he said, she said' environment, which is exacerbated by the absence of centralized reporting and oversight.
    - **Agency Collaboration Barriers:** Teams Hub 1 described how the new media agency, W Promote, faces difficulties in advising franchisees due to limited visibility into key metrics such as membership needs and churn rates, further complicating media spend and campaign planning.
    - **National Fund and Media Spend:** It was clarified that while a national fund supports upper-funnel marketing activities, there is a lack of visibility into conversions at the gym level, as data is not integrated beyond the initial click, limiting the effectiveness of national campaigns.
- **Data Visibility, Attribution, and CRM Limitations:**

Teams Hub 1 outlined the current limitations in data visibility, attribution, and CRM integration, emphasizing the inability to track member journeys from lead to conversion and the absence of automation and segmentation needed for performance-driven marketing.

- - **Attribution Gaps:** The team highlighted that they cannot attribute specific ads to in-gym sign-ups due to the lack of segmentation and integration between marketing and gym management systems, resulting in missed opportunities for targeted follow-up and performance measurement.
    - **CRM and Marketing Automation Shortcomings:** Teams Hub 1 stated that their CRM and marketing automation systems are not optimized to collect or utilize member data beyond the initial engagement, preventing the brand from reaching the entire member base with unified messaging.
    - **Retargeting and Audience Enrichment:** The group discussed ongoing efforts to improve retargeting in collaboration with W Promote, but noted that the absence of a Customer Data Platform (CDP) and audience enrichment tools limits their ability to execute advanced retargeting strategies.
    - **Forecasting and Measurement Challenges:** It was mentioned that the current measurement approach is primarily retrospective, lacking the forecasting capabilities needed to understand the impact of daily membership fluctuations on monthly targets.
- **Cost Per Acquisition and Media Optimization:**

Teams Hub 1 and other participants reviewed cost per acquisition (CAC) trends, industry benchmarks, and the impact of media agency strategies on performance, noting the need for improved optimization and the influence of gym age and market factors.

- - **CAC Trends and Benchmarks:** Teams Hub 1 reported that CAC has ranged from \$88 to \$125 depending on the time of year and market conditions, and compared these figures to industry standards, with SNAP running around \$77 and other brands targeting \$60-\$70 per join.
    - **Media Agency Strategy Shifts:** The group described how previous media agencies applied uniform strategies across all gyms, but the current approach involves more targeted spending, especially for underperforming or older gyms, to improve conversion rates.
    - **Lead Versus Join Metrics:** It was clarified that the team primarily tracks CAC rather than cost per lead, due to limitations in automation and follow-up processes at the gym level, though efforts are underway to improve direct communication and lead management.
- **Sales Process Evolution and Member Engagement:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed the shift from traditional in-gym sales processes to more centralized and digital approaches, the need for balancing personal engagement with automation, and the importance of effective follow-up to convert trials into memberships.

- - **Centralization of Sales:** The team described the transition from decentralized, high-touch in-gym sales to more centralized member management, noting that the current system is still evolving and not yet fully effective.
    - **Balancing Automation and Personal Touch:** Teams Hub 1 emphasized the need to balance digital automation with in-person engagement, as some members require additional encouragement and follow-up to convert from trial passes to full memberships.
    - **Follow-Up Limitations:** It was noted that follow-up is currently limited to email touchpoints, with no SMS capability, which is seen as a significant barrier to effective member engagement and conversion.
- **SMS Communication Barriers and Legal Concerns:**

Teams Hub 1 explored the obstacles to implementing SMS follow-up in member journeys, focusing on legal compliance, opt-in/opt-out management, and the lack of a unified system of record for communication preferences.

- - **Legal Risks and Compliance:** The group recounted incidents where franchisees inadvertently sent SMS notifications to members who had opted out, resulting in legal challenges and prompting the legal team to restrict SMS usage until a compliant solution is found.
    - **Opt-In/Opt-Out Management:** Teams Hub 1 discussed the fragmented nature of opt-in/opt-out tracking across different systems, with no global management in place, leading to inconsistencies and increased legal risk.
    - **System Integration Challenges:** It was highlighted that changes to communication preferences in one system (e.g., gym management software) are not communicated to others, making it difficult to ensure compliance and effective member communication.
- **Manual Processes for Promotions and Affiliate Programs:**

Teams Hub 1 described the manual and time-consuming nature of managing promotional codes, referral programs, and affiliate partnerships, which limits scalability and the ability to track and reward member and influencer participation.

- - **Manual Promotion Management:** The team explained that setting up and managing promotional codes and referral programs requires significant manual effort from both their team and Ryan's team, making it difficult to scale these initiatives.
    - **Affiliate Program Limitations:** It was noted that the lack of system integration prevents effective tracking and compensation for influencer-driven campaigns, as franchise gyms may not honor codes or use compatible systems.
- **Customer Data Platform (CDP) Evaluation and Data Challenges:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed ongoing evaluations of CDP solutions, such as Treasure Data, and identified key challenges related to data cleanliness, normalization, and the need for education on the benefits and practical applications of a CDP.

- - **CDP Platform Considerations:** The group shared that they have had discussions about platforms like Treasure Data, but emphasized that broader understanding and buy-in are needed before moving forward with implementation.
    - **Data Cleanliness and Normalization:** Teams Hub 1 identified data cleanliness and normalization as foundational issues that must be addressed before a CDP can deliver value, noting that current data is not always malleable or predictive.
    - **Education and Expectations:** The team recognized the need to educate stakeholders on what a CDP can realistically achieve, suggesting the use of tangible examples to illustrate member journeys and the potential for improved targeting and engagement.
- **Next Steps and Action Items for Unified System Planning:**

Teams Hub 1 agreed to follow up with a written summary of key issues, non-negotiables, and departmental requirements for a unified system, with plans to consolidate input across departments and continue the project through ongoing meetings and validation.

- - **Written Follow-Up Request:** Teams Hub 1 was asked to provide an email summary of the four main problem areas and to outline non-negotiable requirements for the new technology stack, to be shared with the group for further planning.
    - **Departmental Input Consolidation:** The plan includes collecting non-negotiable requirements from each department, layering them with existing ecosystem maps, and validating them with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
    - **Ongoing Project Structure:** It was agreed that this initiative will involve multiple conversations and touchpoints, both in-person and via Teams meetings, with IT driving technology-focused projects and other departments contributing based on business needs.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Documentation of Issues and Requirements:** Send an email summarizing the four main issues/problem areas discussed, along with a list of non-negotiables and requirements for a unified system and new tech stack for the department. (Jake)
- **Departmental Non-Negotiables Collection:** Provide any additional thoughts or items that were not voiced during the meeting but are relevant to the department's needs for the new system in the same follow-up email. (Jake)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

is the software side of it, so I deal with motion soft 99.9 Italian so my primary is setting up all the pricing for all the gems, and that includes all three brands, so I I also do the John Re brand, goals and Hy Met. Mostly goals. HyMAT, not much, because they don't change their pricing, oras golds and John Reed change their pricing year two weeks, every month, just depends on what they want to offer. If something's not working, they're going to try different offer to see what we' stick when they're buying with the members are buying. So it's a moving target, moves a lot. So that's primary, what I do, then I also work with motion vibe, which is the app side of it, where the members can put classes. do our payrolls and our payroll is handled out of that side of it for some of our gems. And then mostly that's what I do, and then I handle some of the issues with the apps, but that's not really software side of it, but my biggest pain point, of course, is just the constant pricing changes that we do a lot of. So I have to constantly build that new bundles. and then work with the digital team on making sure those bundles are uploaded for them on a spreadsheet that they can grab and then update their pricing on that. There's no It'd be nice if everything was automated, it would just pick all the pricing bundles that I have set up for that and just take it and upload it versus working on this team to help make sure they have it ready to go when the bundles are alive, their sites should be live at the same time, mine are alive with the NG side of it. and then of course, I support all the 48 clubs with they have issues with members, Bendles, anything that they can't resolve as emotion size side, I have to help resolve it. If not me, then I'd go up to the team at motion stop tell me, resolve the problems. Yeah, so sometimes it's customer care, sometimes it's the building team, the accounting team, she's involved in some of the VI.. reporting and digging in, understanding the day. Like, how does motion soft serve up this particular data point that we need to be pulling into said report for a payroll, operational reporting, what have you? So because of her internal knowledge of learning Moso, she's become that subjectmentary expert in that go to person. So in addition to just the normal responsibilities that she touched based on, it's like the, what the hell is this era? I don't even know why it's doing this. Let's go find Kim and talk to her about it. So it's kind of like, can't figure it out, go to Kim kind of thing. So obviously, again, my concerns are, is that scalable now when we're at the franchise level, you know, kind of thing? Like, what are our concerns there? What does this really mean? What are our responsibilities start and stop those kind of things? Because it's kind of like I'm doing that franchise scaleability of a very small level right now because of the three brands. How many How many locations are the other two brands? There's four of John Reed and one of Hyatt. Okay. There's not Because I have to make it's not huge, but it's a huge on the back side of the things because I have to make sure work rolls. I have to have set up different work rolls at this location can do, that this location can do, and they cannot intersect with all three brands. So if I'm a Golds member, I cannot look at a highMAT member's information. I can't take a payment. I can't do anything in the same go through all three brands. They cannot cross intersect. So I have to make sure they're blocked from even touching each other. So there's a lot of security level stuff I have to do on work rolls, and there's creating a work roll for every organization, which could be, you know, it depends on how we handle the franchise, how many work worlds do I have to have, how many franchise need to do what? Because we've kind of done this before with gold, when we ran, it's called, was it the 100 Gyms of 100 Days Our Express Gyms? The GGPP. What was that we did with Hershey? What we had it? Yeah, we built we building mansments on behalf of the. Yeah, I'd already talked to a little bit about that. That was where it was like, it's only like four franchiseises that opted in in between Kim and a lot of Tracy's team having to support those things, it became the four o'clock email of add new items. Give me a new trase. Yeah, you couldn't touch items. They couldn't do anything. I all geLCodes were driven by us. So they couldn't do anything. They needed an inventory item, I had to add it. I had to make sure it was right to the right GL code. Pricing, bundles, everything was done by us because of those GL codes had to be correlated to our GO codes. So it was cumbersome. Very cumbersome. And rarely ever adhered to the We needed 72 hours in advance of when you need it in order to make sure our team has time to do it. It's the Friday 4 o'clock of a Saturday sale. So when you're looking at a franchising all the nuances that each ownership has, how do you bring that into one software company, depending on who, and if we change or if we move on, is it able doable, scalable? Because right now it's just me. handling 50 some odd. What are the memberships like, or bungle? Is it Well, right now with our Golds gym, we have three online pricing bundles. We have a 12 month offer, a month- a month offer, and then we have another offer where they can buy personal training, which is included. So, like, we had a special, no d till January I got our 12 month offer, so I had to build a bundle for all 48 gyms, clubs that had this offer. December 8th, we changed the offer to \$26 on the 12 month offer. So I had to create another bundle for this new 12 month offer on the 8th. This bundle went away, because this new bundle came in place of it.. So it just depends on what the o side do, because if things aren't working and they're not seeing, because, you know, we rent off budgets and revenue, we have to make those numbers. If it's not sticking to the wall, they're going to try different offers to see if it's going to pique someone's interest. Usually we do dollar offers, we do a bunch of things just to see what's going to work. So it's never stable in my world, it's constant moving. Hi Matt, it's easy. High Met never really changes. I think we've done one price change in the 2021, we took on HMT, and that was it. Their stable, they just have other nuances. John Reed, it tends to because Germany runs that outside of it more than the North American side. They're the ones dictating it. The pricing seems to move quite a bit more and fluctuate more throughout the month. How do they communicate changes? I have a Her name is Emma. She's our marketing gal from John Reidside. She will communicate to me about the pricing. And again, it's operator error, she does things, again, operator put in something wrong, an email. It's a constant me having to ask, are you sure that's what you want me to do? Because it doesn't So there's a lot of that. It's the integrity of where it's. The corporate clubs? same. Corporate clubs. She works with the corporate. No. No, she works for John Reid only, and then I have the marketing team here, which is Kendra, and then we have calls with our mark with Robbie, and of course, Danny, and he's at one of the CEOs. We manages that side of of it, the o side. So we have monthly calls where we talk about the operators that are coming up, along with Jake from our marketing team, they will dictate the price. I get an email outlined the operator we're going to have. And I'm on the call too, so already know what's going on. I don't have that with the John Reed. They give it to me in an email. There's no conversational type calls where we're all talking as a team. which is, could be more scalable because that's where the airs are the mails are not for the wall lined out. Gotcha. Well, and you're one person, so you can control it. Yeah. So you don't have to deal with, like a team environment. You're starting to expand, like the company wants to do. How do you manage that when you have how many domestic gyms and ownerships and how does that get translated down to who? So I'm not set up a bungle inside of mosos I can't speak to exactly how it's done. But if you had a perfect system, what would it look like if you had to roll out on these changes? Is there a way to make that more efficient? No. No? I don't see how we could, because we have different items based off. Is it a corporate versus a direct bill versus a retail? And we use the same items for retail. We use the same items for direct bill, and we use the same items for. And those items come underneath a bundle, right? Exactly. So if I do retail, I use different certain items for the retail. And Tracy's doing her direct bills, which I'm not sure if you met with her yet. She uses different items because it's all GL driven, which relates to the finance team and what they use for the PNL. So there's different GL codes for every single thing. Personal training, to get different pricing for personal training that we offer personal training as a paid and full offer or for our group, our members on Golds want to do EFT, they can get it built every so many sessions a month, added to their account every time we build them. So, I don't know if I'll ever see a perfect world of what I want, because, how do you manage It doesn't I have never seen something exist that would be easy. And I don't think they're, you know. I mean, I've known we've got to different companies and looked at them, but we've just never seemed to find one that will work. We have to kind of finagle, get it to work, how we want it to work. Our upgrades and downgrades and renewals handled. A member can upgrade by going to a gym that's called a rewrite. If I'm a month a month member, I can rewrite to a month a month. So let's say I belong to it, what we call level one. It's the lowest level club, the pricing, let's just throw it out. It's \$29.999. I come over to our Burnett location, all of this beautiful gym, it's brand new. It's55 a month. I'm only paying \$29. I can go over to that gym, and they have the ability to rewrite me from this lower price to their price. I pay a difference of the upgrade fee based on what I got bill, what my dues are. I'll pay the difference, and then I build my new gym is them and I build their new rates starting the following month, whenever that's going to be. So they can rewrite, they cannot downgrade, we don't allow downgrade, you can only go up, and I cannot join this gym to use Burnette. I have to pay the you know, we have Venice Golds Gym, which is our higher price club. It's 120 bucks a month, but they have to either cancel and go to that gym or they can rewrite, but they can only rewrite month to month to month to month. If I have a 12 month member, I'm locked into 12 months. I cannot rewrite to go down to a month to month'c there's there's this great offer I want, I'm sorry, you bought this. You're stuck in it for the 12 month term. Well, cancel you for the future, and then you can, once you're canceled, you can join whatever offers there at that time. And that's the thing is our pricing tends to be sometimes the previous month is bad, the next month has a better offer, they want that offer. So we do have people that are month to month, that are constantly rewriting because the offers are changing and are more enticing that that's what they do a lot of them. Sometimes this is operationally problems that are operationally driven. And what I mean by that is if I've got somebody paying \$29.99, and they're willing to pay \$69.99, but that particular gym and that particular offer is month to month, and let's say they've got six more months of obligation at 29, Am I willing to park ways with 29 for the 69 in hopes that they stay at least three months, probably to recoup what would have been the last six months of obligation. Nobody takes that into consideration. Nobody does the math. Nobody allows for overrides, necessarily of that. No one, when we're strategically pricing things, says, I'm not allowing any of these members to upgrade to this great new gym with all these new amenities, because they bought an obligated, you, a 12 month contractual obligated gym membership, and I'm not going to let him out of it. We do. You know I could be charging almost. Yeah, and to his point, we do have those members, but we have what's called a level up membership, where I can level up and pay the difference of what my current offer is, let's say it's 29. And this gym is 55. Our back office people can level them up and charge the difference, and then they pay the two agreements. Yeah, it's like a secondary agreement, it's a secondary to feel that, that they can now access this gym, this gym, they're paying X a month and they're still keeping the rate at this club. What we tend to find is when we run these month-to-month offers, we seem to recycle to our same members over and over and over again because it's a month-to- month. The offer is better this month than when I got last month, I'm going to rewrite. So that is a lot of what we see. And then you look at. So imagine imagine this concept times, 50 other franchise business owners, all thinking that they know how to create the best offer. We looked at like DC Metro where the flashlight every other hour, every 12 hours. And now you have the recording component, right? Your KPIs. So in our world and today's world, we track new members, new membership revenue, you know, all these other things. Okay, if a member signs a new agna, or rewrite, what have you, they're not really a new member, right? They just upgraded, typically or downgraded in some regards. by doing a rewrite. We don't count them as a new member, but the definition traditionally of a new member is who signed an agreement within this month, but we now have this lodging says, if you had a prior agreement, that got canceled on the same day, meaning you pretty much cance this one and start the new one, we're not going to count you as a new member. We do count the aspect of the revenue, because it truly is revenue if there was up front page. the credit of ET difference, but our thing would have considered a member is a brand new member or someone who hasn't rewritten in the last 30 days. Yeah, so if you were canceled in the last. If I even canceled within 30 days and I come back and rejoin, I'm not a new member. So that's how that's our logic. So we have to have report team write all this stuff. And we still have it for our finance. It says, here's all the members. However, we have this column called Newmember Count 1 or Zero. We exclude the zeros, because they're not new members, so that's how we know who's a new member versus not. So there's all this logic and all give ex example last year or two years ago, we rolled out this new, we did a price increase and we changed our pricing over. I rewrote, within three weeks, I did five different bundle changes in three weeks. They kept changing the pricing once a week. That is room for air for this person that has to do it, and it has happened where I've screwed up big time, because there's constant moving, shifting, and when it's a human touching it, stuff is going to happen. Stuff happens. Stuff happens. Yes, it's now I have to be very cognizitive and when I'm doing stuff to make sure, because when I copy bundles or create a bundle, I'll set it to one gym and then I can copy that bundle and apply to all my gyms. So that one has to be correct, that first one, because once I copy and screw up, I screwed it up 48 times To fix it, I can either go in 48 times and touch that again or just end them all and start all over what we do is called copying replace, where I can copy that bundle. replace it with a new one, but still have those items there. Or maybe I put an item in there that doesn't belong, I can remove that item before I save it and make the changes, then I got to copy it all, 48 times again. But that happens. And so it's very me having to go back and make sure, okay, I just dotted across the T, down of the eyes. And to me, some of these are, as I explained, and I think it was the billing meeting or maybe the operational one, that these are nuances, some of which are dictated by the way motion soft works, where we have to do it this way because this is the way it works. A new system might change the way it works, hopefully for better, not for worse, but as we ask the questions of franchisees, like, do they have in the systems they use the concept of rewriting a membership? Or as a cancel existing, sell a new one? PIs can be interesting where I don't want to wait all the way to the last minute, you know, like my pith expires on 120. Do I want to sign up on 128 and lose two days? No, I want to sign up in advance. I want a member to sign up in advance, sometimes even a month in advance to be prepared, but have it actively start. That's what we do. Right? Which, yes, we have that ability, but we've seen other systems where it doesn't. So you're taking the risk of waiting to the very last day for them to sign a new patent full agreement, because if they sign early, they're shaving off the last three weeks or two weeks or a month of it, because now I do start date, 12 months out, right, just overlapped and shave off. Yeah, we have rules in within also that allows us to dictate what a staff never can do with a renewal. They can renew them up to 90 days before they expire, so they can do that. The price is built in from when they renew, it gives them what they had last year. So they just hit renew. On I renew, I'm now pending on the new one because my current one's still active. When this one expires, then the new one kicks in from me and goes from a pington active. But there's rules that we can build in like how far out can they renew, how you know, so we can control that. So that's some stuff, you know, and you're looking at different things. The renew function is inherent to the gym engine system. There is no API that allows you to do the same function from an API standpoint. So I can't cue up everybody who's going to renew a pain in full agreement, shoot them a link and say, "Hey, you're coming up for expiration in two weeks, " renew." The only place that exists is for a body to click the button, to select renew, and go through the process within motion soft, right? So we're looking for trying to find a way around it with less human touch points for even that, but. I mean, even selling PT online would be a nice to have, you know, I buy membership, I want services. What offers can I get online? I don't have to do at the gym. Once a year, we'll run a for PT offer for \$220., and they just type their barcode in, it pulls them up, and they buy it, but they have to use the card on file that's linked to their membership agreement. That revenue will go to where the member belongs. But let's say I want to go to Belterra, well, I belong to B caves. The revenue hits B caves because that's where my membership is, but I'm training over here, because they can train in any location. The revenue will go here, but the PT is trained here, so now I have two places I'm paying someone out of one gym, but the revenue's over here. So I don't know if our accounting team has to do anything to account for that because of labor where the labor is versus where the revenue went, I don't know. Yeah, you could look at a gym. I don't think you would ever see it significant enough to, like, make a decision of this is an underperforming gym we need to close it. But we know that we have had members that sign up at a particular gym, but mostly utilize a different gym, right? Because most memberships are. We do sell a home club, but most of them are. We don't sell home clubs anymore. Yeah, Pretty much inclusive of the majority of our clubs, except for one or two upper tier clubs. So again, if whatever reason we had an offer that was significant and where people signed up at this particular gym, even though they might primarily work out at some other gym. And most of our markets are close enough where we don't have that problem, but we have one gym way out of the tip of Brownsville, Texas. It's the only gym in the area. And there was years ago, a time when, as an isolated gym, we ran a really good offer, and for people living in San Antonio, where it's what, three or four hours away. It was worth it to be signing up at Brownsville Go sign up. Brownsville for that discount and then just come back home after a nice weekend down at the beach and sell Padre. and have a membership that' \$20 cheaper than anything in San Antonio. It's a membership arbitrage? Yes, yes. And we don't see that problem as much, but we don't have everything is standardized. But we've closed gyms. closed a couple of gyms, you know, last year or so for, you know, typically underperforming reasons. One was just a sell that made sense. One of the things we do is we look at cross utilization, like, how many people have this as their home club but have never used the club or 90% of all their usage is some other club and definitely not their most recent one being this club. Well, in their minds, that's really not their home club. Let's move them, right? Because even though that is their home club, they build monthly from that home club, the revenue receipt from their billing is attributed to that. They're using a different club. So here's this other club that's highly utilized getting the wear and tear, needing the additional staffing potentially, not getting the revenue because they' recurring bill is sitting over here. Again, some of those are our problems and how we manage that world. Well, it's a nice to have because they're old company had it where I can uncheck your gym B caves and check the new gym, and just to check mark. Now my money goes to that gym. Most of's agreement driven, so every time I need to do something, that agreement has to be rewritten in order to move to this gym. We don't have the ability to do that. It was one of these nice to have a promise. signed document, not just changing your home. We're not changing anything else about the amount when we draft, the terms of the agreement. We're just changing your home flow because that's what makes sense. We can't do it because it's tied to the agreement. So we have to have most of do those changes and luckily, we don't have to pay for that because they will charge us a fee, but because that was something that was promised to us when we moved to them, which was eight years ago, they never developed. So we don't get charged for that. But some other franchise could. So these are things, you know, when you're looking at companies, what's the what's theseiest way? I just want to checkbox and say, I want that money now to go to this gym and build on the next door cycle, the revenue going forward. Yeah, our bulk change or something like that because there's things we can do that we, you know, we can bulk can, so we can bulk notes, we can do budget things, but price bulk price increase, we just got. But when we change pricing, we used to have to send it to Moso. But now there are things that took them eight years to get to us, but we can do. But agreement driven stuff is the main a big pain when you're trying to move somebody, because if you want someone I moved, okay, I can update your address, but your agreement still stayes where you're at. And that's the thing is people move so much. Their gym is wherever they join, but their new home address is where here, and now they're using this gym because that's their new gym.'s closer to them. So as we try to think of the one system and company gms and franchises merging together, scenarios such as, okay, I think I might have two different franchises in Virginia. I do, right? I think the Lowells are in Virginia, but also, obviously, DC Metro is DMV, right? So they've got Virginia g. What if a member wanted to transfer? Well, technically, if we're thinking as a franchise or, you're in the golds umbrella. I'm a golds member. Should it matter that I signed up with this one? Well, if you committed to a 12 month agreement, they're gonna want their 12 months of your money and not want to let you go to go to this one. And I think that we either have to say, that is the rule, or we have to say, "It works both ways. If we all agreed to play by the same rules, there's going to be members that come from their land to your land, and your land to their land, and it's probably going to be enough of a balance and a mix that we should do what's right for the member. And that's where we have to be, you know, forward thinking and what's right for the Golds member that ultimately is going to work effectively for franchise to franchise or franchise to corporate or whatever that scenario is. We did those services at for their biggest franchise every quarter, you'd run a report. We re allocate and you would move people who had nine or more check ins had a different location than they they got the revenue for the next quarter. And everybody agreed to it, and it was in their franchise agreement. We ran, we gave a very clear report on who's about to be moved, and we made the movement for them, and stuff like that. And you know, retro does that, you know, today, you know, with, I think they're on ABC, but they have the same agreement, right? Because you can have access to their entire network when you join a retro. It makes the most sense.. Mon needs to go where they utilization is, but we'll just move every record. Yeah, if you think about, if your perspective is what's right for the customer, and you're signing up for the Golds brand, I mean, that's what's right for the customer. You shouldn't say, "crew you, you go finish out your last eight month of obligation before you can go work out to where you want to work out kind of things." So then are we, this might be quite before, but are we thinking, one? I know we're talking one system, but is it one environment for all franchise and corporate? Or is it separate? So then that means that when you're talking about the bundles that you make for your pricing that means you're also doing all the bundles. I've done it before when we had small subs, were determining what this means to say, does this mean that I hire three more people? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Or do we say, we don't want to take on this responsibility, so we're going to find a way to find the right system that can delegate the responsibility to only control their world and not the greater world. She's got keys to the kingdom, and she delegates access accordingly, if it can be segmented. Well, then you got to deal with the online digital side because now those bundles have to be sent over and that team has to manage it. And you know theory no. No. But In theory, it says, if you create a bundle that's available online, we're going to pick it up in display it and sell it. Right, but but to your point from the earlier meaning, that's the development part on the website more than a development part on the operating. Yeah, that comes down to the technology choice to make that more automated. Well, it used to work great, but we moved to a new platform for digital, moved to a new website. Now it's become more of a, excuse my language, pain in the ass. Because I can go in early in the morning and change. I use one bundle, that one bundle works with both the online agreement. The only the online sees, and what's in Jim. Bef before we should do two bundles, one for online and one for for freight, for in Jim, I like, why are we doing this? One bundle can be handled two different ways by agreement driven. I can block them, not seeing this agreement, they can only see in gym. So I can get up and I change in gym pricing early in the morning, for the gyms, I do that the night they close, I'll go up and get up and do it. These guys, my digital team, doesn't do it as they should. It takes 10 minutes. Yesterday, we had pricing changes for a gym. They didn't get a dent until 11 o'clock In the meantime, the offer that was supposed to have ended is still out there, no dues till January. That offer should have been done at midnight to the flip to a new offer, which is \$26. for 12 months. That shouldn't happen. It should be either one automated or well, it should be automated that way., let's get rid of the. One goes away, the new one starts on a specific time, based off time zone or whatever, starts at that local time and this live and it's not waiting for that group to get because oh, they're in a meeting now, they can't get to it. No, I'm sorry, but this is a more of a priority than a meeting to my world. Well, I think that even with the newer system that has better integrations and automations, whether minimize to the best of your ability, the human touch that needs to be put into it, they's still going to be the audits, the oversights, the problems, or whatever, to say what they do today, are they positioned to be able to do that for another 150 gyms? Because you get one or two franchisees that create a couple of new offers and they're supposed to do this is my Valentine's Day special, and here we are two days before Valentine's and I don't see it. What's going on. I haven't got a response out of the digital team. I said something to support. Like, we will be the punching bag if we are the source of system ownership, because we believe there's a certain amount of control and audit that we have to maintain and can't just allow it to be the Wild West, which is the right way to do it. We have to be committed, that we have round the clock services almost to accommodate what their needs are going to be. Because that Otherwise, they did happen yesterday to give it up on an aud andches. They told me they changed the pricing. Okay.. I went in two hours later, and the homepage still said no dues till January. The offer said, no, pay no dues till January, but the price was 26. So me joining, guess what I paid? I paid \$26, but it says here, no, no dues till January. So now you're giving this member a bad experience because they're assuming they're going to get no dues till January. So there was no auditing from that side to verify the home everything that they have on that offer should match to what the offer is. I went, Guys, this is wrong. You'd seen this. So I had an now alerted my back office team because you're going to get members and we do this all the time. It's said on here, no ds. How come I got charged? Now we're having a refund them if they make a big stink, so now we're dealing with that piece of it. The time. The timing issue and making sure the verbage is what it should be at the time that that thing is like. So those are just some of the nuances. Yeah. Two different systems, right? So they can be out of sync. Because you got Yeah, you got the website side of it with software side. So, does goals charge like enrollment processing first blast? It depends on what the opera is, so right now, month to month, it's \$34.99. Some we fliping. Right now, it's anniversary billing, so when you join today, you pay your first month of \$34.99. There's no enrollment on that. There's no enrollment on the 12 month. It's26 for 12 months, and then you roll over 26 month to month. So the goal is to get people to buy not month to month, because we don't want to be cancel, we have to keep them longer. So they entice them with this 12 month offer that's a better rate locked in. It's26. No enrollment, but there is a process fee of \$59.9999 on all of our memberships online. Our group rates, we do not charge a process fee, but then those are in G, which we're going to roll out online soon, but still again, no enrollment fee for our group rates. That's the kind of get people that buy into a different company who's literally get a better rate. But yeah, we do offer we do charge. And your fees? \$599. 60 days after they join, and then once a year after that on that date. So if I joined this month, it's December, February 15th, I'm built at my first annual fee, and then I'm Bill 15th of February every year thereafter, as long as I'm done. Gotcha. And what are some of the things that you configure, that you know, are global configurations? And every system's going to be different. What's global emotion soft might be different in some other system. But as we think through, like, I think for example, when we assign like NSF fees, like if they decline.. Is a \$20, I think it's a20 fee. We don't charge. And that's the other thing.'s No. I have to, well, it can be, but because ChaE doesn't charge a decline fee, I have to set up HyMAD with that NSF fee at zero dollars, so anytime they are or is it John Reid, some of the gyms don't get charged in an NSF fee. So I can't send it to Gold's holding because it hits all the gyms, so I have to set it up to it has to be. So you have to set up a an item or a return item or whatever it is that says, even though it's still an NSF, because it's the NSF, John Reed, nothing. NSF Golds is whatever we call it. So, again, imagine now 150 different gems with 50 different 70 different franchisee owners that all want different things, and now suddenly I've got this bastardized cluttered system because I've got NSF version 1, 12, 3, 4, 10, 15, 20 to accommodate everybody that has a different price points. These are things where we have to think, can we agree to globalize, like, is there that much difference in late fees where we should be doing something different across the board? Well, there should be anything is probably configured. It's global, right? So if we can't all agree to it, then. Well, you got figure it cancellation rules, too, because that's another thing. I have different cancellation rules according to John Reed behind that and Gold. Goals, you have to give me a 30 day notice. We have a portal that is handled that. The portal nose based off certain things, if you paid last month or whatever, when your last day will be to cancel, based off our built in logic. Hi, Matt. 30 day notice. John Reid used to be, I could cancel one day before my billing, and we allowed the front desk staff and the gym staff there to do that. Again, work roll base, so I had to say, if you're John Reid employee, this is what you can do. If your gold's gym employee, I had to change manipulate the work world so I know who was Gold's G versus John Re Hyman, manipulating what they can do, can't do like our gyms, our employees here, goals cannot cancel.. So what was originally just the GM roll? Because we were only Gold's Gym. RSGep purchased us, introduced John Reid as a brand. It's like, "Oh, but they're gonna do things different. Okay, so now I have to create a G slash.. They made it more of a one-stop shop for JR. because of what they are paying, were as gold, through everything was 30 days. John and you can't touch it, but your John Reed immediate cancel, you guys have the rights to do it. And then they's time at. So again, I have how many different work roles because of how. What's this company, A1? There were employees to do. What is company P employees want them to do? And how do you put that all in different work roles or whatever? So that would that's cumbersome. And I haven't seen a system yet, I just because I haven't seen it, where I can say, you as the top level admin can grant permissions to Kevin to manage his employees, so he can create a new employee and assign him whatever role that new employee needs, but he doesn't have enough rights to actually create his own new role. Yeah, exactly. Or maybe he can, you know I mean, those are a lot of those things, I mean, those are the things where, like, nobody likes to talk about the weeds, but they're there, and we're going to get into them. Our employees came in view other employees. We girlsls because they're not allowed to go in there and touch it because that's where the payroll ID sits. That's where a bunch of stuff sits. If they go in there and screw up a payroll ID, because we use that to pay an employee, we don't know who they are because the payroll ID does not exist in ADP. So ADP is our source of truth for everything, but if I'm an employee and we have our ITT, all new employees into golds into our system, whether it's high Matt, John Raad or Golds. If they t that payroll ID and wrong, guess what This guy's not getting paid because motion five has the payril ID sitting in it as well as gold. Those two need to match if they don't, it's going to cause problems. So, and you have an employee typing, good fat finger. We've talked about using ADP to insert it to mul over. I mean, but again, not there.s we't be there for franchiseises anyway, because we're not going to manage their Europe systems. But yeah, at the end of the day, we will have 15 John Smiths across the board, and I need to know that this John Smith is different from this John Smith and the payroll system and they're unique by their payroll ID. So as he trains out sessions and he sells memberships, I can generate what is their commissions or revenues or compensation or what have you. The factors into how they get paid out in our case, ADP and some other franchise, whatever system they pay out of, there's probably going to be that need for that unique payroll identifier, and I don't know that we're looking to integrate with any or all. We haven't even done it for us. We're damn not going to do it for everybody else. We haven't even talked about the IT because they get anytime our HRT will gets a ticket, he creates an approval process, it creates a ticket that ticket, depending on what it just goes to these guys on RIT team, they create their active directory account. They set up their work role in Mosso, they do all this other stuff that gives them the rights to do what they do when they log in to active because each person has their own active directory log in into the desktop.. So there's that component. For us, there is a lot of smaller franchisees. Don't use active. may not even have a domain or the need for a domain, right? They They can log into like a work group or a computer with a generic login, launch whatever the application is. Within the application, motion isolved ABCs andana, they have their loggin that gives them whatever rights and things they're able to do. But someone has to set that. But yeah, we're just we are of a size and have always been at a size, you know, when we were like 150 plus clubs and our largest, where, you know, we operate more as an organization than just a franchise owner with one or two gems. Well, if we go to this one system, who's going to put the employees into the system? Yeah, that's my whole point is we probably do not want to be in that business. It's the franchisee, whoever, whether they delegate that to the general manager or someone within their gym or their own internal HR person, would say, Joe Blows's our new hire, and they've been doing, you know, they're starting there on the job training or wherever we're on board and they go through and whatever point they need to log in, they need to be able to create it. But they don't need to have the rights to be able to say, while I'm here, I want to create a new role, too, because I want to introduce this new job function called X,YZ job role. And they accidentally put in the wrong location.. So it has to be location lockdown, work roll, lockdown, everything, so they can't touch other franchises or corporate locations. Yeah. I think that's easy to map. I built that in a point of before we left where if you're a GM, at a location unit to add, you can't assign any role that has permissions greater than your own, you can only assign rols that have lesser permissions than yourself, and then any subordinates that have access, again, you can't duplicate an advent login, you know, they can't, you know, kind of a thing. But that was easy. The brand level controls were definitely a big area in the RFI and RFP process and when we review. We want a system that allows us to build a lot of stuff up top and push it down, whether it be membership, whether it be rows, whether it be locations, whether it be the NSF FI, you' right, you know, all of a s globalally configured items, the better, right? Because that gives everyone the ability to configure those particular things. Well, it's globally determined, but the price is set at the location, especially for sales tax, right? State sales tax, or even city sales tax, depending on. And that's the other thing is, our sales tax, if I'm Texas, Texas seems to have one tax rate \$8..25. But if I'm Oklahoma, we have three gyms, they all have different tax rates. It's possible. So we have to create Oklahoma gyms and out of it. They're not lumped under Oklahoma, I have to have it. Yukon tax rate, I have to have it. Quails rate, tax rate. So, again, globalization again, it's based off that city with their tax rates are. So that's another thing to look at is how do you handle? Because we can globalize it based off location, We have ability. In tax rates, typically are configure inc as many as you want, call them what you want to buy, we have we have bar. It's more about those things that are truly globally configured that say, you've got one shot, and whatever you choose applies to everybody, right? And that's thing is your feet. Yeah, like, yeah, annual feet. Well, yeah, we have taxes based off, is it a food tax? Is it a carbv tax? Is it a car carbonated tax? I mean, we've got two extreme when we had a guy from finance. He wanted a beverage tax for every damn item depending what it was. Just wasn't called sales tax. Well, you need that in New York, but you don't think you need it here. We don't need a year, but again. We needed it somewhere in some state we were in at one point. We're literally the difference between all of the water versus a carbonated beverage. one that contains enough to 2% fruit juice, qualified. for Texas, we had that 50% or less taxes for that.. And then we have vending machines, and that's a whole different story in itself, but that's here and here on this meeting. But. Lots of weeds, lot of weeds. pull a lot of weeds every day. We here. I'm the gardener of Gold's G. So have you given thought of, like, what the mustavves are from the new system? with all these nuances? No, not entirely. Must have, nice to have, you know. No, I think that's where I struggle trying to find the best approach. I mean, we we've started lists, you, we've done, let's just throw everything on the whiteboard we can think of, because we've got to think of it. And then let's figure out how to categorize it, how to ask the right questions or whatever, and then it's like, all right, well, this is kind of um operational based question. Oh, but it's also kind of an accounting-based question. Is it belong this bucket or this bucket or, you know, part of it was just had a structure some of the, you know, the things that we needed to be taken into consideration, but no, we need to as, you know, I mean, first and foremost, I mean, I think the goal is to ask all the right questions that we believe we need to ask in the franchisees and re ask our own selves to understand the importance of everything, to then say, this is now my top level prioories must have right when we get to the R 5 piece." Yeah, it'd be interesting to hear from the franchise first to see what their what they want to do, because we kind of already know what we can do with golds and how we handle things. It's more where they come from, because I think for us to know what company to go with, it has to handle everything. And these guys, the franchise people are very demanding. Yeah. And so each one's different and unique. And so you're gonna have that's where the problems are gonna come from, I think, for you guys. Yeah, it'd be interesting. Yeah, I almost feel like even though it's probably probably would be over Okay, we know we're talking about doing some hs sit with a couple of key French Azzies, right? That's going to give similar insight to what we're doing today and tomorrow. with these particular franchisees, but it's only going to paint a portion of the picture, not in the entire picture, a survey, while valuable, is only as good as how well they actually answer the questions or you know, expand on the explanation of what they're trying to convey, I almost feel like once this is all said and done and ran into the reviewing the results of the survey, then it almost needs to be like all hands franchise or whatever. We're gonna talk about these things, and we're going to allow questions, and it's it's gonna be a shit show free for all, not free for all, but arolled chaos, but like, it'll allow those to have a verbal voice and talk about some things, concerns, are you gonna take away this from me? Are you gonna do this or whatever? It might not come out thisarily in a survey, and we can't onsite everyone. But I feel like we need recordings and people feverishly taking notes and listening or whatever, but allow in this greater big audience to start getting some feedback once we had not just a, let's just start shouting shit out, but like, as we go through the survey and talk about topics, okay, in this particular topic or area, does anybody have any questions, concerns, additions, things that weren't expounded upon enough and continued to get that feedback, even post survey from verbal conversations and input as opposed to just the written survey. Yeah, I feel like the survey's gonna be a Hopefully starter. Yeah, set some light bulbs. depending on how certain people respond, we're gonna want to pick up the fond and say,Hey, tell me more about that. But to Brad's point, the non negotiables, we have to determine those, and those are the things that we're going to shout out in the beginning and say,You guys want this? Here's the non negotiables. Here are the things that we all have to agree to in order to make this thing successful. What's deciding the nonnegotiables, is that Brad and Danny?, I mean, I think I mean, I like. It's gotta come from those people.. Like even good government. It's a body of people weighing in. ultimately. Yes, there's a president or a decision maker. I' that they've got a cabinet. I'm changing the district seats on the. You're jurymandered. Yeah, but you still need to have to your point, you need to have a president who's setting with the agenda is and sets what the clear, important things are. I think has to be us and then you go to the franchisees and say, what are things that you need brought into this as well? I mean, part of the reason these two guys are here is because they bring a certain amount of skill, knowledge, and background and experience of having gone through this and doing it, learning things from it, and, you know, to say, I'm gonna spend money on these guys to help guide me through this, to just say, "Oh, you think I should go down that path? Oh, thanks for your course. I mean, like, so I think it' it's a combination of what they learned from you and Carrie and Tracy and, you know, all of us to ultimately say, we believe you hear some key takeaways in direction or whatever, at the end of the day, yes, we're gonna make the decision, but it's based on all these findings, all these opinions and ideas, thoughts, and what we all believe is the best approach and best way to go.. But, yes, ultimately, Danny and Brad at the helme. Well, I'm just saying, I don't there's ever be a good approach. I just No, it's it's. From what I've dealt with with just for three brands and what we did in the past, I'm on almost 24/7 because I had this franchise that needed this or needed that. And I just wait till tomorrow. I'll get it to it tomorrow, you know? Those are things you have to look at is, how do we handle this? Is that, okay, you know, we give you two days notice, is it a one day notice, or is it I need it now? Or something's broken? You know, what's the process for that? Because you know, shit happens all the time with this. We have APIs that fail. We have other problems, you know, I're taking a bigger picture. The way this process will work is we will at some point pick our horse that we're going to ride, and we will say, we've got 50 gyms to think about. We've got everything that we've built, every single dependency from the integration to our Joint Online, to our website, to Hubspot, our PowerBI reporting, our commission reporting, you know, sequel reporting services, everything, everything has to be retooled to a new system. Are we going to be converting day one? No. The decisions we make day one are readily available to the net new franchise at that team hopefully can go and sell and say,This is going to be a turnkey package." Well, I have early adopters who only have one or two gyms that it's a lot easier for them just to lift and shift? Yes, great. We'll support be 150 gyms day one. No. Will he be 50 company gms day one? No. It will be. It will be a potentially a new franchise that's onboarding depending on the timing you can think get the right sell might be one of the first. I think we have to put it in place, be it a pilot or be one of the early adopters or whatever, but I think that what you'll find out is enough people have contracts in place and all of their change management processes of training of staff, how I do my commissions, I'm heavily tied in this system and this system, this system, and you're telling me, you all need to go away to change out for these systems, I need time to do that, and we'll see this gradual increase of adoption that allows us to say, day one, I don't need a hire 10 new people. Day one, I get to kind of dip my toe in the water and see how much of this is going to really be time consuming and then ramp accordingly, based on, you know, how that looks as franchiseise slowly onward to the system. Do you guys suggest software companies to for us to look at based on what you hear? Are you guys know? I mean, are you just listening to what we have and say what you need to this is the path you should go to. Making a call right now? You mean on a software? No, no. No, maybe three meetings in. What are we doing? I think we all have the top five of industry standard players that we know are of a caliber to do the type of gym that we are versus a boutique kind of situation. Well, I know,'ve looked at those. But in addition to that, there are some kind of some dark horses out there that are, you know, that I think we should look to explore like, and I can't think of the name of it excer. Yeah, excerpt. I think might be one. What's the one Aaron and I looked at at the event here in Dallas? Is it snap? No. Uh, wouldn't snap, but something like that. Yeah, it had an actionable kind of name. Anyway, we talk a little bit with them or whatever, to just dismiss them, I think, would be wrong. So, I mean, at this point, you know, are we going to put a list of 25 of them out there if we can find 25? Probably not. But to say that we're only going to limit ourselves to the three or four that have been talked about so far, I think is doing the injustice. And there's no perfect system. No, there isn't. Yeah, it's basically It's a combination of the business processes and white system, and you want a date because they're all ugly. Yeah. Or is Willie says, all systems up. Tell us why yours sucks the least. Yes, yes, pick the system. out of don't overprise under deliver because that's kind of where you guys are. Part of this exercise too is the business processes and given your goals where you want to be three, five years from now, what do we need to change operationally and just how we do things? Yeah, or what can we change operationally simply because the way we do it today is too much of a pain in the ass. So let's just find a better way, even if it's not just a driving technology three years vision, it's just like, this is stupid. We're doing it this way because we painted ourselves into a corner five years ago with this particular system. So we just do it that way. Right. doesn't make sense. Can, anything else you want to check out on the table there? These guys should hear from you today? Well, I think I chucked enough. We appreciate you. Yeah, it was very good on Po. Thank you. I go back to gardening. Go back to Pull the weeds. Go back to the weeds. Do You want to hang for a minute as we kind of talk next steps, training for the futures and were gonna be hoping us to put all this into the PMO. Yeah. I mean, obviously, we've got more of these tomorrow. I think from there, we want to try to
