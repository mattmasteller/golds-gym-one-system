## Document 1: Summary (1 Summary.md)

**What it covers:** High-level synthesis of the December 9-10 HQ meetings with 8 departments.

**Key takeaways:**
- Gold's is at an inflection point: shifting from corporate-gym-focused to a **franchise-growth strategy** (16-25 new gyms/year)
- Current tech landscape is fragmented: corporate on Motionsoft, 80%+ franchisees on ABC, 20-30+ different apps in app stores
- Five common themes emerged across all departments:
  1. "We're not best in class"
  2. Need for standardization
  3. Asset-light model preference
  4. Franchisee change management is critical
  5. Website/app as quick wins
- **Urgency is real**: Kevin (VP Franchising) said 2 more years of inaction will lose credibility with franchisees
