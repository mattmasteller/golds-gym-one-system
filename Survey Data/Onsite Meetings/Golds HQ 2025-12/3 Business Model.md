## Purpose

This document defines Gold's Gym's strategic business model for the next 3-5 years. Its purpose is to serve as a **decision filter for all technology choices**. Every vendor evaluation, platform selection, and integration priority should align to this model. If a technology decision doesn't support these goals, it should be questioned or rejected.

## The Gold's Strong Model

**One Sentence:** Gold's Gym is a strength-first, technology-enabled franchise system built for performance-driven members who want serious training, elite recovery, and a community that celebrates results.

### What Gold's IS

- A strength and performance brand with 50+ years of heritage
- A franchise-growth company targeting 16-25 new locations annually
- A premium experience priced above HVLP competitors
- A lean, technology-enabled operation

### What Gold's IS NOT

- A general-purpose fitness center for casual exercisers
- A low-price, high-volume (HVLP) competitor
- A big-box gym with pools, spas, and childcare
- A corporate-gym-focused business

---

## Five Strategic Pillars

### 1. Strength Dominance

Gold's Gym facilities are purpose-built for serious training:

- **Massive free weight zones** with expanded dumbbell ranges, Olympic platforms, and specialty equipment
- **Performance turf and functional areas** supporting HYROX-style training and athletic conditioning
- **Small group performance studio** for strength and conditioning classes (not traditional group X)
- **Posing room** honoring Gold's bodybuilding heritage
- **Content-enabled spaces** (≤15% of floor) optimized for workout recording and social engagement

**No pools. No childcare. No spa amenities. No HVLP dilution.**

### 2. Recovery as Revenue

Every location integrates a recovery and biohacking suite:

- Cold plunge and contrast therapies
- Infrared sauna and red light therapy
- Compression systems
- Percussive therapy stations

This suite is **tier-gated** to drive premium membership adoption. Off-days become gym days—recovery visits increase engagement and justify premium pricing.

### 3. Lean Operations

The staffing model is asset-light:

| Role | Model |
|------|-------|
| Leadership | GM + AGM only |
| Front Desk | Minimal, self-service enabled |
| Training | Hybrid in-house and outsourced |
| Marketing | Standardized playbooks, shared resources |

Technology must **reduce headcount**, not create it. Self-service check-in, booking, and payment are mandatory.

### 4. Unified Franchise Platform

One operating system powers the entire network:

- **One membership system** across all domestic locations
- **One mobile app** for all members
- **One data model** feeding analytics and reporting
- **Brand-level controls** with franchisee-level flexibility
- **Real-time royalty visibility** based on actual transactions, not self-reporting

Corporate operates as a "super franchisee" on the same platform—no special treatment, no parallel systems.

### 5. Premium Positioning

Gold's competes on experience, not price:

| Tier | Price Point | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Basic | $49.95+ | Full gym, excludes recovery suite and performance classes |
| Performance+ | $69.95+ | All-access including recovery, classes, and HYROX integration |

This positions Gold's at **2x HVLP pricing** while remaining below the $90+ luxury segment. Premium pricing attracts tier-one franchise candidates who expect turnkey operations and strong unit economics.

## Facility Model

| Attribute | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Size | ~30,000 sq ft (25,000-35,000 range) |
| Layout | Strength-dominant floor plan with dedicated recovery suite |
| Access | QR codes, gates, 24/7 capability in select markets |
| Amenities | Recovery suite, performance studio, posing room, content zones |

## Target Member

Gold's Gym serves the **performance-driven fitness consumer**:

- Bodybuilders and physique athletes
- HYROX and functional fitness competitors
- Experienced gym-goers seeking serious training environments
- Fitness content creators and influencers
- Athletes in training

Gold's does **not** target:

- Casual exercisers seeking variety and amenities
- Price-sensitive members prioritizing cost over experience
- Families requiring childcare
- Members seeking pool, spa, or resort-style facilities

---

## Technology Decision Framework

Every technology decision should pass these filters:

| Filter | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Strength-First** | Does it enhance the training or recovery experience? |
| **Franchise-Scalable** | Can it deploy to 150+ locations without manual configuration per club? |
| **Asset-Light** | Does it reduce headcount or automate manual processes? |
| **Data-Unified** | Does it feed one data model or create another silo? |
| **Premium-Justified** | Does it reinforce why members pay 2x HVLP pricing? |
| **Member-Facing** | Does it improve the member experience or just internal operations? |

### Non-Negotiable Technology Capabilities

1. **Brand-level controls** - Push configurations once, apply to all
2. **Franchise segmentation** - Each owner manages only their locations
3. **Flexible banking** - Multiple bank accounts and processors supported
4. **API-first architecture** - Integrate with gates, InBody, recovery equipment
5. **Real-time revenue visibility** - Royalty calculations based on facts
6. **Member reciprocity** - Check-ins across domestic network with tracking
7. **Tiered access control** - Recovery suite gated by membership level
