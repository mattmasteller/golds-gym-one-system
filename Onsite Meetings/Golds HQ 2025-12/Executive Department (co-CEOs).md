**GOLDS Executive Department (co-CEOs) 2025-12-09**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Three-Year Vision for Franchise and Corporate Growth:**

Brad, Danny, and Ryan discussed the strategic vision for the next three years, focusing on maintaining a steady number of company-owned gyms, exiting underperforming locations, expanding franchise units domestically and internationally, and developing a best-in-class franchise playbook to attract top-tier franchisees.

- - **Franchise Expansion Plans:** Brad outlined that the company aims to add more franchise units both domestically and internationally while maintaining a steady portfolio of company-owned gyms by exiting underperforming locations. The expectation is to open 16-25 franchise gyms per year, with some closures as older agreements expire, keeping the overall mix relatively stable.
    - **Development of Franchise Playbook:** Brad emphasized the need for a comprehensive franchise playbook that includes design, construction, real estate, and especially technology, to meet the expectations of high-caliber franchise candidates. The playbook will serve as a standard for both new and existing franchisees, ensuring consistency and operational excellence.
    - **Resource Allocation and Support:** Danny and Ryan discussed the shift in resource allocation, noting that while the company has historically focused on supporting its own gyms, the future will require reallocating resources to better support franchisees, especially as the franchise network grows. The goal is to create a scalable support model with minimal increases in human capital, leveraging technology and standardized systems.
    - **Corporate and Franchise Portfolio Mix:** The team clarified that the number of company-owned gyms will remain steady, with growth focused on the franchise side. There will be some opportunistic buying and selling, but the overall portfolio mix is expected to remain largely unchanged, with the majority of growth and challenges centered on the franchise community.
- **Standardization and Integration of Technology Platforms:**

Brad, Danny, and Ryan addressed the need to standardize technology platforms across all gyms, aiming to move franchisees and corporate locations onto a unified tech stack for improved efficiency, data visibility, and support, while considering the challenges of legacy systems and franchisee autonomy.

- - **Current Technology Landscape:** Brad described the current state as fragmented, with corporate gyms and franchisees using different systems for member management, billing, and operations. This lack of integration leads to manual processes and limited data visibility.
    - **Project One System Initiative:** The team discussed the 'Project One System' initiative, which aims to bring all gyms onto a single, integrated platform. This would allow for consistent operations, easier onboarding of new franchisees, and better support for both new and existing locations.
    - **Non-Negotiable Standards and Franchisee Buy-In:** Brad highlighted that certain technology standards will become non-negotiable for new franchisees, with a roadmap for existing franchisees to transition over time. Achieving buy-in from the franchise community is recognized as a significant challenge, requiring careful planning and possibly amendments to franchise agreements.
    - **Data Integration and Reporting:** A key goal is to centralize data from all gyms into a single data lake, enabling better reporting, transparency, and the ability to support franchisees with actionable insights. This will also facilitate more effective marketing and operational support.
    - **Third-Party Perspective and Vendor Selection:** The team values having a third-party perspective to ensure objectivity in selecting the best technology platform, rather than defaulting to what is already widely used. They aim to choose a 'blue chip' solution that meets the needs of both the company and franchisees.
- **Operational Model and Amenity Strategy for Future Gyms:**

Brad and Danny detailed the operational direction for future gyms, emphasizing a tech-forward, self-service model with streamlined amenities, reduced staff, and a focus on core fitness experiences, while selectively incorporating wellness and recovery services.

- - **Tech-Forward, Self-Service Model:** Future gyms will prioritize technology-driven, self-service operations, including online sign-ups, QR code access, and minimal in-gym staff. This model is exemplified by the Thornton location, which serves as a template for new gyms.
    - **Amenity Mix and Facility Design:** The amenity mix will shift away from underutilized features like pools and group classes, focusing instead on strength and performance areas, recovery rooms, and streamlined retail. The design will emphasize a distinct Gold's Gym aesthetic with improved lighting and sound.
    - **Selective Approach to Wellness Services:** While there is interest in wellness and recovery services, Brad and Danny agreed that these should not detract from the core fitness experience. Outsourced partnerships for services like physical therapy and hormone therapy are being considered, but the company will avoid becoming a 'jack of all trades.'
    - **Consistency and Brand Identity:** Remodeling efforts are underway to ensure all gyms have a consistent, recognizable Gold's Gym look and feel, moving away from the varied and sometimes generic designs of the past.
- **Franchisee Support, Professional Services, and Scalability:**

The group explored the extent of support and professional services to be offered to franchisees, debating the balance between providing essential back-office functions and maintaining an asset-light, scalable model, with technology as the primary enabler.

- - **Scope of Franchisee Support:** The team discussed whether to provide services such as billing, collections, and reporting for smaller franchisees who lack the resources or expertise, recognizing that many currently rely on their technology vendors for these functions.
    - **Asset-Light, Self-Service Approach:** Brad emphasized the desire to remain asset-light, focusing on providing franchisees with the right tools and resources rather than building large internal teams or call centers. The goal is to enable franchisees to operate independently within defined guardrails.
    - **Scalability Through Technology:** Danny and Ryan noted that with the right technology platform, support can be scaled efficiently without significant increases in headcount. Examples from other fitness franchises, such as Crunch, were cited to illustrate this approach.
    - **Professional Services as Optional Add-Ons:** The possibility of offering certain back-office services as optional, fee-based add-ons was discussed, allowing franchisees to choose the level of support they need while keeping the core model lean.
- **Marketing, Consumer Acquisition, and Data Strategy:**

Brad, Danny, and Ryan discussed the integration of marketing and consumer acquisition into the technology stack, the need for centralized CRM and automation tools, and the importance of data-driven decision-making for both local and national campaigns.

- - **Current Marketing and CRM Limitations:** The team acknowledged that while a CRM platform exists, it is primarily used for corporate operations, with limited automation and no centralized customer database spanning all franchise locations.
    - **Future Marketing Technology Goals:** Plans include implementing a unified CRM and automation tools to enable better communication, lead management, and loyalty programs across the entire network, supporting both local and national marketing efforts.
    - **Data Collection and Utilization:** Centralizing data will allow for more effective tracking of leads, member engagement, and campaign performance, enabling data-driven decisions and improved support for franchisees.
    - **Martech Integration and Ownership:** The company aims to own and control the top-of-funnel marketing assets, such as the website and CRM, to ensure consistency and effectiveness in lead generation and follow-up.
- **Implementation Challenges and Franchisee Alignment:**

The team addressed the challenges of implementing new systems and standards, including the need for franchisee buy-in, potential amendments to franchise agreements, and the importance of building consensus to ensure successful adoption.

- - **Amending Franchise Agreements:** Brad explained that implementing new technology standards may require amending existing franchise agreements, typically through a majority vote, and updating the operations manual to reflect new non-negotiables.
    - **Building Consensus and Managing Change:** The team recognized that gaining buy-in from long-standing franchisees will be challenging, especially for those accustomed to their own systems. A phased approach and clear communication of the benefits will be essential.
    - **Early Adopters and Transition Timeline:** Some franchisees are expected to be early adopters, while others will transition over time as contracts expire or as they see the value in the new model. The overall process is anticipated to take several years.
- **Operational Reporting, KPIs, and Sales Accountability:**

Danny and Ryan described the current and future state of operational reporting, including the use of dashboards, key performance indicators (KPIs), and the shift towards greater sales accountability through technology and streamlined processes.

- - **Standardized Reporting and Dashboards:** The company uses automated reporting tools and dashboards, such as 'Gym Stats' and Power BI, to track key metrics like membership sales, revenue, and personal training performance. These tools are being standardized across both company and franchise gyms.
    - **Sales Process and Accountability:** The sales process is tracked using set-show-close metrics, with an emphasis on leveraging technology to automate follow-ups and lead management. The goal is to maintain a low-pressure sales environment while increasing accountability for results.
- **Operating Manuals and Best Practices Documentation:**

Danny and Teams Hub 1 discussed the status of operating manuals and best practices, noting that while some documentation exists, a comprehensive, up-to-date manual is still a work in progress and will be based on the evolving company gym model.

- - **Current Documentation Status:** Some operational documents and an OPS manual exist in SharePoint, but these are not fully comprehensive due to ongoing changes in systems and processes. The 'strong model' playbook is being developed as the foundation for future best practices.
    - **Future Plans for Standardization:** The company gym model will serve as the proof of concept for the operating manual, which will eventually provide a turnkey guide for franchisees, covering all aspects of running a gym with allowances for certain local variations.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Franchise System Standardization:** Determine and document the non-negotiable technology and operational standards for new and existing franchisees within the next 6 months. (Teams Hub 1, Brad, Danny)
- **Franchise Agreement Amendments:** Set up the framework and process for amending existing franchise agreements to mandate new system adoption, including understanding the required majority vote and mechanisms for implementation. (Teams Hub 1)
- **Franchisee Services Scope:** Decide the extent of professional services (e.g., billing, reporting, call center support) to be offered to franchisees, especially smaller operators, and at what price point, as part of the discovery process. (Teams Hub 1, Brad, Danny)
- **Operating Manual Development:** Review and update the current operating manual and best practices documentation to reflect the evolving systems and processes, using the company gym as the proof of concept. (Danny, Teams Hub 1)
- **KPI and Dashboard Sharing:** Provide the specific set of dashboards and KPIs used for daily operations to the team for alignment and integration into future systems. (Danny)
- **MarTech and CRM Integration:** Formulate and document the standard for marketing technology and CRM ownership, including the website and lead management process, to ensure consistency across the franchise network. (Teams Hub 1)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

I cut them off back in it'cause I hit the recruit button. So, yes. Yeah, the record button show me down. And then, you know, there's gonna be some obvious things like we know we' a jump company. We know what we need to do. kind of thing. So, like, let's just jump into the meat potatoes of it and, um and just go as hard as we can while we got Brad. And then if Danny can hang on longer for the full hour, then great, if we feel like we need to try to reconvene at some point and get some more time with Brad, obviouslyviously more, I think in this case, early on, is probably better for these guys, so let's jump into it. Okay, sounds good. Can you still hear us, Ryan? Yeah, I'm good. I think the reporting kicked in, and I'm back and good. Great. Okay, gentlemen, go. Well, kicking right into a rat, I think the most important thing for us with your time is really understand what three years from now looks like, right, from your perspective or kind of what you're thinking. know, we can kind of back our way into that, because right now, the vision piece is probably pretty critical, as it relates. So I'd be curious, we've heard the 150, three years from now franchisees. We're super, super focused on corporate. Obviously making the transition of franchise, sometimes different resource sets, infrastructure people, that type of stuff. But what do do you envision in three years from now in between you and Danny? Yeah, I mean, I think. Um. Three years from now, you know, we. Yeah, I mean, I think it's very straightforward, right? We have a few more company own gyms. We've exited some of our underperforming company owned gyms. So our portfolio stays about the same. We've added franchise units internationally, domestically, we've filled our pipeline, blah, blah, blah, everything's cranking on all cylinders, The important thing, I think, for this conversation is that three years from now, we want to have a much better traditional franchise or playbook to deploy to franchisees. New and existing. Meaning if we're gonna get real blue chip franchise candidates to come into this brand to sign up for a multi deals. We have to offer what would be considered table steaks, brand standard kind of stuff, that they're expecting from any brand that they would partner with, right? So, what is that? That is, you know, design construction, real estate, technology, right, being probably the biggest one of all about, right? So the in gym and above gym tech AC, the app, the website, the integrations that allow gym to talk to other Jim, that allow us to see and assist with billing and invoicing and blah, blah, blah, right. So all of that, things that make the life of the franchise operator easier, that will all translate and make the life of our owned Jews better easier, et cetera. So we can operate in a more efficiently, mean, fashion, with more visibility, more transparency, better reporting, you name it. Right. So this is to me, this is this is, take the playbook that every brand wants or has that's of any sort of reputable nature and just copy and paste. That's it. That's the mandate. Now, the challenge is we have a disparate system where corporate gyms are on a system, you know, front end, back end, so in gym, member facing, you know, back office, et cetera. We have our own stuff. Franchiseise have several different systems out there that kind of their standardship management system. They have their own, you know, their own buildinging, platforms, and credit card processing platforms and all this kind of stuff, right? And to a certain extent, we want to give Francesis the flexibility to run their business their way, because we have to. But the things in the future that are going to be non negotiable, we have to decide in the next six months. So when we call this project one system or whatever we want to call it, right, what it really means is getting everyone on the same platform over time and being able to, this year is coming year. be able to slide across the table to new franchisees and say,This is what you're doing, this is your stack, right? And all that integrates and all that jobs with everything else, that we are doing on our side to make your life easier work to support you the best way we can. Existing franchise is slightly different, but over time, we want them to all be on the same systems so that we have visability into their sales or their membership counts, into their pricing tiers, right? I mean, you name it all that right now is fairly manual and not integrated into any Data lake or sort of a hub of any kind. So that's kind of the other piece of this, is that we in the near term, we want to be able to say, to franchisees, this is what we expect. These are the non negotiables, and then existing here's where we're going, roadnap was. And then we have to be able to do something with that data, right, or with those integrations, we have to put all the data somewhere, have it, you know, plumbed correctly, I guess you could say. So that's the vision, right? And I think one of the reasons why we think it's important to have a third party perspective on this is gives us a little bit of sort of cushion, a little bit of sort of back up when it comes to some of the decision bending, isn't just a mandate from a corporate because 80% of our system is already on ABC, so everyone needs to go to ABC. No, we've been thoughtful about what we do as a business, what you guys do with your business is across the revenue streams from a membership standpoint and auxiliary revenue, and retail, and all that kind of stuff, and we've found the right system that allows you to do all those things. So do it, right? That's what we won't be able to go do. Understand? Yeah. Quest, we've been to a few of the gyms, obviously been in the industry a long time. Gold's Gym, Standard Box. What does that look like? 'Cause they're all very a bit, right, from a from the perspective is no standard. Right. So the technology platform supporting that, what does that look like? Cause we're talking about, like the new people coming in, and has there been any thoughts on that with the Gold's Gym box of the future looks like?. What do you say box, the future we talk about? Physical four wall. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we walk in the amenities. The amenities, the amen mix and whatnot. Some of the gyms right now, like the one I visited in Thornton, which is a beautiful gym, by the way. You know, very streamlined, you know, Baney staff, you know, are people sign up online, they check in, you know, and have the gates.. Yeah, kind of like that. No group X. You know, they've got personal training, but it's just the rental kind of model. The food beverage retail is bending machines, small, you know, retail area. But is it that, or is it more like some of the other older gyms I guess? It's like that. Okay. Yeah, it's. You know, it's people like in terms of more tech forward. Gotcha.. You know, scans, QRs, sign ups online, you know, it's. Self-service. Self-service, but, you know, with, you know, the pools are kind of going away in exchange for that, you're getting more strength and performance. The, some of the auxiliary amenities that are under utilized are going away, you're getting recovery as a priority. Recovery rooms, recovery, kind of services, it'ss really just getting back to our roots with an elevated feel at an elevated sort of engine experience. That's where we are, right. Gotcha. The GGX kind of Group class thing will stay in most of our gms that have it. But going forward probably won't open new gyms with that group class format. It'll be more lifting area, more racks, more dumbbells, basically. You know, we're going away from in gym media, right? So limited TVs and displays at around the gyms. Everyone's got their own display and their pocket. And it makes the aesthetic cleaner, the lighting of sound. Everything is a better experience. Yeah, okay. 30,000 square feet, ish? Yeah. 25 to 35. It's kind of a sweet spot. Okay. So that Thornton one is kind of like a good model. Thinking of the future club. Yeah. Okay. Where do you stand on, sort of the future table stakes as it relates to this shift into wellness? 'C obviously some of the gyms are we have gyms like right now, obviously looking at incorporating that, where do you stand on that? Um. So I have mixed feelings about it. Okay. And it's it's pretty obvious. It's like, everyone wants the Auxiliary services to a certain extent, right? But should we be that center hub for all those things, right? Should we be the PT place? Should we be the pepides and the blood work and all that kind of shit? I don't know. I think we want to make sure that we are 100% focused on the culture, the vibe, the member experience when it comes to what they're there for predominantly, the 90% of what they're there for is to work out and get a good training session out. We have to make sure that we're not compromising on that in order to do the wellness stuff and whatever. Everyone, you know everyone talks about it in the administry, but no one's really making a ton of money off of it. because it's you just hang a shingle on the wall and you say, we have recovery and wellness, and we have this and whatever, right? Yep. So to a certain extent, it's like, you have to balance, or you going to make a ton of money from this, or is it literally just a tablespakes thing to get members in the door? Yeah. You know, we're experimenting with some PT stuff, but outsourced. We're not going to do any other stuff in house for a variety of reasons. Some of our franchisees are doing, you, blood work and longevity kind of stuff and hormone replacement therapy kind of stuff and all that. Under a different business, but under kind of Gold's Gym, you know, sort of four walls. I want to make sure that we're dialed in on the things that are most important to us, and we don't get too distracted and become this jack of all trades, everything, everything, because that's what got us into this mess in the first place, right, is that we have cardiocininemas and we got, you know, we got some gyms look like Venice, and some of them look like LA fitnesses, and some of them look like, you know, it might as well be a hotel hotel, you know, Megacorp, you know, just vanilla, nondescript, you know, sort of crappy fonts, like every every gym company looks like back in the mid 2000s, right? I So we're remodeling gyms to put a very distinct look and feel that is very gold's specific. There's no doubt when you're in one of our new gyms that it is a gold's gym. This is not the every gym, you know, where we just took an old Toys R Us and threw some weight equipment in there and locker rooms, right, which a lot of those big box gyms look like. So,. Yeah. Cool. And then on on the mix percentage, throw three years from now, you sounded like corporate's gonna kind of stay steady state from lose some gain sum, but at the end of the day, R 50. What does that look like in three years from now, the mix? Is the mix adding additional 25% unfranchisee? Well, realistically, you can't add that me in three years we'll probably open 20 16 to 20 franchise gyms this year. So I would expect that to kind of be in the kind of 1625 gyms a year. We're going to lose some to, some of the older ones are going need to go away when their fise agreements come up. So you know, it's kind of a you know, it's really just. This process is 100% about the franchise community. Yep. Right? Because that's where all the growth is going to be. That's where the issues are. We can flip the switch and do whatever we want in our own gyms, right? We can get rid of our existing platform and go a different direction over the next 12 to 18 months if we want. So that's easy, right? We just want to this decision will, God, what we do on our ownms as well., and it's there'll be some opportunistic stuff where we can buy some, sells some, you so the mix of our portfolio will stay about the same. So that shouldn't that shouldn't change down. Through loss and a new gain. Yeah, and you know, it just put on, you know, we're not gonna go. We're not gonna go buy out 100 franchisees and then go open another 100 gyms on our own. It's just not happening. Yep. Right. But, you know, over the next five years, we've won. materially sort of increase the number of franchise that's out there. From a resource support perspective, I believe a majority of the resources internally are focused on corporate. Is that correct? How much of that will be shared versus incrementally added on, from a people perspective. Um, I mean, it's just you know, we've just always defaulted to take care of our gyms historically, right? And I think there's a way to add a few resources, but really just kind of shift. If you're all speaking the same language on the same systems, you create an easier framework to operate in. Correct. And so you don't need a ton of bodies. You just need to reallocate, kind of. We're not running their gyms, you, we're not running their back office. We're not necessarily driving, you know, all their customer service and all that kind of stuff, right? That's a bigger picture thing that we're not really tapping into right now. But we, you know, when you're all in the same platforms, when you're all, you know, on the same sort of stream of consciousness when it comes to rather new membership growth, right? We understand what's going on at gyms, that we can be more helpful with our support, with our, franchise kind of operating partners, et cetera, that are around the field, from a reporting standpoint, you know, we can have a finger on the pulse of kind of pre impose on how some of their pricing and promotional things we be performing, right, how the marketing is doing in different markets when it comes to driving tangible membership growth for franchise, all that stuff that's's to me, where I see the short term value and then long term and there's the opportunity to turn on the juice in terms of like actually driving growth within the franchise system will becoming, you know, very much franchise e focused, right? If we have 40 gyms that we run, but we've got 250 franchise gyms, right? I mean, we need to be able to say to the franchise community, like, we are adding value into your units, right? We are. The reason why you sign up for Gold's Gym is not just to put a logo on the doors it's because we have the resources to support you. How far into the market? Yeah, and I. Go ahead. Can I add something? Yeah, let me add some real quick to that. I think, you know, when when RG came in the picture, they were just kind of starting up John Reed, Jaim Matt was still under construction, both, John Reed was looking at being on Gowf. Ja Matt was being looked at for a product called Resort Suite. Both of those different resort suite, obviously very complex, didn't do all the things we wanted it to do as we dug into it. We kind of said, "We believe motion soft can do all the things." And that's kind of an example of where we streamline those three brands all functioning similarly. It was scalable as far as all the resources, both IT, the billing team, the accounting team, all the things basically follow suit. So I think it's, you know, it's Brad's point, is we look at the franchisees, will there be resources more than likely, yes, that are needed, human capital, that is, but as far as scaleability, adding on, I mean, at one point, we were 160 company owned gyms, 165 company owned gyms, and staffed not much more than we are today, so it's scalable if things are consistent. I think that's going to be important. And we do need to keep in mind, as well, as we go through this process that while the focus is golds and the golds franchise business, that it makes sense more than likely to shift both John Reed and HyMatt to whatever this new platform system is as well, so we're not supporting legacy technologies and doing things in different ways as well. So it's a tangential piece, definitely, you know, an afterthought, but it has to be carefully considered for the overall RSG brand as well. Understood. Uh, question I had for you, preliminary conversations in the field, but how far does the stack move into marketing? Consumer acquisition? It seems like a lot of the brands there are some of the franchisees are kind of doing their own thing as it relates. So is there a spot where this starts and stops? Is the entire stack all the way around the acquisition? Well, I think, you know, we don't chargege franchise as a tech fee at all right now, you Some of them were charging them legacy monthly fixed marketing fees, et cetera. I mean, I think long term, we get people on a percentage revenue, contribution to an ad fund, and then we get them on a 1%, you, or whatever, tech fee that we build, you know, we have a CRM platform, but we're only leveraging that really for us, right? We don't have a CEP, we don't really have good automation tools that we own and control from that CRM or CDP, right? Meaning we don't necessarily know all of our customers, right, and we don't have a centralized. Unless you come to our website, right and you sign up for just Golds Gym, corporate, corporate, right, we don't really capture you. if you go look at a franchise's location and go to their local page and all that, then they kind of capture you. Yeah. And so we don't really have a way to talk to the broader community as like a full view club, right? Like a million, two million, three million person e club community or kind of a loyalty base that you would kind of think about, like, if you have the app, I have the goals gym app. But guess what? That app doesn't translate necessarily to, you know, the guys in DC, the guys in Florida, the guys where, you know what I mean? Right? Nor can I go scam my barcode that they're gyms and there isn't even a tier where I can join that tier and be a member of that gym as well, if I want to go to that gym. So, we're talking about big picture things that are going to be very challenging because it's not just about flipping a sweat. It's about getting buy in from the franchise community and figuring out, you know, a lot of these sort of structures and legalities to some of this stuff, but we want we want the ability, we want the optionalality. We want we want to be the main control mechanism. I mean, like I said, to kick this off. if you guys know what makes a vest in class franchise or, what we want to move towards that, right? So if if it checks that box, then we're interested in it. It may not be priority number one, but it's gonna be on the kind of five year roadm. Because we, you know, for not doing that, then what are we doing? We're just kind of we're gonna be a licensing model and allow financheses to do whatever you want, and just rely on, you know, the lore of Gold's Gym and the awareness of the brand to carry us versus be able to kind of get a little, you know, sort of institutional polish, you could say, right, so that we can compete with some of the big guys that are raising big money and and franchisees, that are opening, you know, 100 plus locations, et cetera, that are also raising big money to go support those, the growth of those friends. If we're not in that category, then we're just kind of tier three, you know, just sitting in, cool T shirts, and you, thinking of the old, good old days of Venice B days. And I I really have no interest in that. And I don't think Danny does either I know he just came off music, but.. Jump in, bud. No, I, you're doing a great job. No, I think that's the best way to kind of to set it up as. If we're not doing anything to make us best in class, we have the products, the vision, to be best in class, but the text act behind it, obviously is not there, and living in one ecosystem, you know, I do think as tables steaks, you, the fact that we have no reciprocity between clubs, like, you know, Brad just spoke of is crazy, and so I do think it's gonna dive into every department, including marketing, so.. I think yeah, there's a chaplist that makes you best in class, and we have to ensure that everything's on that, so... Yeah. Now, Brad's good. What's that, Danny? said, you pretty much nailed it, that's fine. sit back a huge.. I usually. As you've seen, I tend to nail it., also very humble. Super modest, for sure. But, I mean, yeah, I mean, I look at this. I look at this as the the easy part of this is the deciding where we're going and what we're going to do. Right. The hard part is then getting by in and translating that effectively to the franchisees that have been with this brand for 35 years.. Or the ones that have been in the brand for four years, but they' pick their own thing and now we're saying we're going to go, you know what I mean? So there's. I've done this at. Well, it's been the case that all the brands I've worked for, but at two different brands, I went through two points sale overhauls, right, with 350 plus unit restaurant brands, which is small in the industry, but a crazy undertaking unit it's a three, four year plan. You know, a year to figure out which platform you're going with, and three years to go roll it out, right? And you got people on legacy and new franchise agreements and all. It's wild. And so we have to be eyes wide open to the challenges, but not let the challenges dissuade us from actually doing the hard things that we have to go into., I I'll leave it at that. There's I got all sorts of thoughts. It's consensus two thirds for changing platforms with existing legacy. franchises. I wouldn't say changing. I think consensus is that we need this. No, in order to conception consensus? What is the Yeah, we have to. Well, you have to amend existing franchise agreements with with a vote that's, a majority vote across the. We'd have to have to set up the framework., it. We don't have a mechanism to look here. I think it's around 80% has to be on before you can mandate or something like that, but we can get that out of the franchise conversation later. You't's what I was led to understand, say. So. At least in my experience, you have a franchise agreement, you have an ops manual, right? And the ops manual tells you how to run. What are the brand standards? What are the non negotiables, right? And the franchise agreement says, you must abide by the ops menu, right? So technically, you can change the ops manual, right? And not change the fridge agreement, but the franchiseise can say, you know, when I sign this, this was the standard.'re changing the standard and I have to abide by the standard. And so there's opportunities when thereents come up for renewal. Francesis want to renew early with a franchise fee waving a fee all sorts of ways you can do this. you know now again, I think having a good understanding of what's out there in our system is step one, really, and I think we have 80 80% of our systems probably on the same system right now. So, you know, kind of leading the witness here, guys, you know, you got 80% of our system on one. We got 40, 50 gyms on Moso, you know, but we got, you know, whatever, 150 out there on ABC and Peak and a few others, you know, there's a bunch of different systems out there, but like. in our consideration set, right, we should really be saying, here's what the stack, here's the components of the stack that we need to have. Here are the outcomes that that stack is can give us that we need, right? And then pieces, parts that need to actually be the kind of front facing and franchisee facing tech solutions, right, for all those things. But it's not like we're you know, we need Blue chip, we need best in class. There's only probably four or five that really qualify in that category. So this shouldn't be like a big broad, you know, how can we ever come to the right conclusions kind of process? This is pretty straightforward, I think., maybe I'm notive to it, but, you know, at least in my past, in the restaurant business, you know, it's it's very straightforward, right? There's, like, three or four blue ships and there's a couple merging, that's it., for sure. So. What, two thoughts, one, You're not wrong. We have to create a system that is attractive to the currentrenies. In other words, we have to create value out of the choices that we're going to make, what we're going to build, so that it's almost a FOMO, and they want to come over, and most of them want to make a change anyway. So that's on our side. The other thing that Mike get brought up to you, Brad was how much are we going to lean in as the franchise when it comes to different operations? Clearly, we have at least two different personas of franchisees that I've witnessed so far. The very advanced individuals, like a Josh in D.C., you know, like a Matt, you down in North Carolina, where they have covered off with personnel, every aspect of running their business, almost as an individual entity, not necessarily leaning on us too much, almost to the point where as I talk to Q, you know, down in the group from North Carolina, this last week, they want to build their own website because R doing online falls short in some of the marketing andoor descriptive items that say,Hey, you're in a network when you join kind of a thing. How much are we going to be willing to add on to, let's say, back office operations for the smallers, for the hys in Tampa, and for those others that don't have personnel to do a lot of the stuff behind the scenes, are we going to be willing to run their billing? Are we going to be willing to create the reports? Are we gonna be willing to take on credit? Or, as you said earlier, we're going to draw a very specific line. And I think that is one of the conversations is that we have to decide over the next several months. as the franchise or how much are we going to offer our services, professional services, we'll call it that, right out of this office for some of the smaller franchisees because they're not tech people, a lot of them aren't even business people, they're just gym people running, you know, running on golds. And I'm not looking for an answer today, but it just keeping we're all wondering how far we're going to lean in as this franchise or, if we're only going to add a body or two as per year state measure just a few minutes ago. Well, body or two common, right, let's not. Everything is hypothetical, theoretical, whatever you want to say. So don't quote me on exactly every single thing. I understand understand, we don't know yet. But. We're not trying to get into the business of running local marketing right now for Kip and Tampa, for example. We're not trying to get in the business of being her billing specialists and her membership consultants and her, you know, run her ERP system and whatever for her behind the scenes. We're not, because it was, you, that that's death, you know, for us, right? Because it, she might as well have 100 gyms, because she's going to think her two gyms are the most important things on the planet and natural ever.. Sometimes smaller franches easier way more pain in the S than the big ones. From a bender perspective, those are. I think one of the things that we need to key in on with the franchisee questionnaire is knowing that most of them are on ABC, knowing that ABC is the probably one of the most oldest and maturest of the systems and offers a full service solution, right? That's where a lot of these franchisees say, "Oh, you're my call center. You process cancellations, you do collections, you do my billing, you monitor my billing, you keep tabs on all those things, where they don't have the don't need those people because ABC does it for them. I think some of your newer ones, your Zenotis and such, they don't have all those things. And so again, I think that's where we have to decide, what are those tables steaks things that we have to say either the system has to continue to do it or we have to do it possibly at a fee, right, as a service. They're paying ABC, out to wazoo to do those things for them today. So things can be scalable at a price point, right? We have to add bodies to support, right? It comes at a price, and we have to figure out what, I mean, it's a discovery session, right? And what this is all about is where do we draw that line in the sand? Is it at the 40 yard line, the 30 yard line, or where, to figure out what we offer, what we don't? And I think, you know, going through this process will help determine some of those things, but I think the key some of the key questions will be understanding what franchisees's take advantage of those services and aren't going to be staffed. I mean, it was like, I think Geronimo, I think, or one of the ones that recently moved to Zenode was like, Zeni sucks. No, Zenoti's actually pretty decent. You just lost all the things that you didn't know Zanoti did, such as your call center, aspect, and your collections and all those things that they were doing from back office. So knowing that we manage collections here and some of those things here, we've got our customer care team that's very small, don't we want to turn into a full golf center? Well, not. Right. So I don't think we need to go, and I agree with the process, but we don't need to go down this rabbit hole Everything is on the table because everything is not on the table. We're not going to become that company, right? We're not going to build a 20, 30 person call center and you know, we're not going to invest, $3 million dollars in marketing, Texac, and we're not going to do those things right now, right? So it's good to know. I mean, I wanted to hear the b of that, I mean, they want to know as much as we are or not, in your vision. So hear the knots, right? It's just as good, you know, I feel like in our notes. We want to the asset light with the right sort of end solutions for our franchiseises and for our own gyms. And we want everything to be as sort of self service as point and click, whatever, so that we can make sure that the lights are on, and, you, the internet works and everything's good behind the scenes, right, but franchisees have the right to kit as a part of this, that we are we are basically, you know, allowing them to engage in this toage that gives them the right sort of. Give him some guardrails, you still, you know, control the brand and, you know, the look feel, but give them give them guardrail so they can do their own thing. By no means, and this is for you guys, more so for you guys. It's like, no means, is this, like, gonna be forever, right, in this sort of framework. Right? But for the next five years, there's no scenario where we're at what I don't fully know, I'm trying to discover myself is what do other franchisees specific to fitness ideally? What does their back office infrastructure look like? How far do they take it? Because maybe we're definitely not going to be there day one, year one, two, three, whatever, but if best in class means taking on certain things, then is that an objective and a goal that we say by year five, whatever, we are slowly. I mean, we can't just say, let's go hire an army of people increase our, you know, the labor side of the house by, you, a million,5 million dollars annually. I think we you know, you know the state of our franchise system and the franchise team, right? Yeah. So we can't sit here and we have to focus on what is this project. Yeah. This project is giving franchiseises what they've been asking for. What have they been asking for? Everyone on the same system speaking the same language, right? So that we we don't we haven't even scratched the surface of like, what we can do to support them, because we can't, because because there's 60 different platforms out there. Right? I think if we look at it from clean slight, I'm starting up a Goals Gym franchise business. What does my ideal client look like? The franchisee that I want to attract, right? If I have a good business model for the new franchise, an existing franchise ideally is going to say, this is a successful model, I've done way too much on my own trying to do all these things myself. Let me just move to the simplistic model. We want to be more of a in my opinion, a desire to get to a better place than I can do it better than you do, and I'm going to continue to do my own thing, right? So we know that day one, there's going to be they're under contract for the next three years with ABC. They can't jump ship immediately. They've got all kinds of internal processes that they have that. The existing franchisees, there's going to be some that're willing to be early adopters day one, but there's going to be a lot that just are like, hey, we want to get to the Promised land, but we got a long journey to get there, you know, just because of the shit over the years that they've, you know, compiled, that they've got to slowly weave themselves out of and get to that place. So to me, the focus is, especially if we're looking to attract new franchisees, is if we figure out what that model looks like, then everybody else eventually comes over, including us, right? We've been through conversions before. It's a multi-year process of planning, you know, the training of the gym, all the things, you know, commission structures, data, every report that you've ever built that suddenly no longer works because it's all in this data source that you have to rebuild. It's a process for people to migrate versus, you, a net new franchise.. The answer to bless him earlier, Ryan is, yeah, there are franches in the gym world that are doing this, and they' they're not adding a lot of human capital. There are a lot of rely on the system. So Crunch is, for example, one, ABC for most of the Frenchanchise, does everything for him. They do a lot of local marketing, but the national marketing, you know, campaigns obviously run just like how we do it. Just a little bit more scientific. and a lot more involved because they have the CDPs and everything, and they have the data to leverage in order to make sure they're running the right program to see what the TPAs are and things like that. So there are systems out there, because I agree with Brad, you know, the acets will be adding as far as human capitalital should be minimal if we have the right system. Yeah, no, I agree. It's it should be scalable where you're not, you know, five new gyms means five new bodies. It shouldn't work that way. never should work that way. Yeah. Cool. I got a jump. Thanks. Thanks for your time. Thank you, Brad. You appreciate any of the other conversations. you want to in. There's a franchise one with Kevin Christie. There's an operational one. Franchise is tomorrow. We have IT billing, operations today. I think Tracy Perry. franchise won tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. That's probably the best one. So we' make sure that, right, I'll make sure you the way we're thinking. It's not good. Thanks for. Thanks, man, sir. All right, Danny's t? Yeah, what? Yeah, Danny's still hurt him. So one. franchise for sure, because if we don't get us aligned with them, then we're this whole thing's a waste.. The one question I still have open ended is kind of talked about an operating manual/b practices. Does that exist today, is that still.. gonna be taking. It's a work in progress. Yeah. Danny, maybe be what we call. Because we don't have because we don't have all the systems in place, there's really no, you know, operating manual that we leveraging outside of some of the basic things that we do in the company side, but, you know, ultimately, the company's gym should be the proof of concept. Okay. I don't that we build a manual off of that everyone wants to build off of his wall, because that's part of, you know, being in my mind, being best in class to franchiseise is you have a foot, that you hand someone that's turnkey, with everything, your vendors, how you run a club. Now, there might be some nuances because it has to be nar, some may have personal training, may not. Some may have physical therapy. Some may have child care, things like that. So for the most part, we best most of it. Some of the docs that I did upload that came from Katie on a franchise group that are in our sharepoint are she would say that that's the ops that they have today, that are going out to the franchisees. So how soon or, I don't know, when the last time was updated, but she's like, if you need a place to start, then that's the ops manual, and we already have it in our sheer drive. Yeah, and then we also got from Kristen, what is our strong model playbook that's been developed last year into this year and rolled out. So even though some of the tech will change, I think it's the process that we think we're going through, I think, is, you know, Danny Craig me, if I'm wrong, but like the process that is that strong model that's been rolled out in the fitness component is kind of like where we are today and what we believe is the direction we're going into 2026 at least, right? Yeah, I know, it's definitely taking, you, things that've done in the past, you know, you, Ryan talking about RSG when they purchased us, you know, a lot of changes were made. So, you're talking five years of kind of evolving into this new models, which we call the strong model, which cut every aspect of the business. I't know that gym within the four walls.. So I do think, yeah, let's say 90% baked, and there might be 10% of that changes just to the evolution of the process of.. Some gems are running lighter than others, but I think for the most part, we've definitely built it out to where if there changes, they should be minor at this point. Perfect. Okay. Yeah, and, like, we've already been working with some of the ops and fitness team, like, for one of the particular tech products, called Demotu that's kind of the engagement and sales component to try to get them onto the personal training side of the house, right, not just the membership, but but selling additional selling into that aspect. That's a work in progress as far as we're looking at integrations to make it better, but again, regardless of how technologically that advances, the concept of what it's used for, what it does, is our model going into 2026. So I think that stronger document that we have is will help understand at least from the company gym perspective of what our sales and engagement model is.. Gotcha.. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Okay. Um, Anything else for Danny while we have him captive here? The only thing I can think of that we didn't really touch on is, Danny, do you have a specific set of dashboards or KPIs that you're looking at daily since you're kind of in the operational side of it? Yeah, and they're pretty universal. But yeah, I mean, Ryan has all the reporting we use that's automated, but yes, I mean, we can give you the metrics, but I will say, for the most part, you know, that's one thing that gym business is it's pretty... It's coffee and paste, even within franchisees.. So, um and even a different brands. From a day to day operational, I mean, gym stats, still the gold standard for us, right? I mean, obviously, there's more.. It is for results, but to me, the tempor we're launching the CRM again, you know, all the KPI was in that as far as sets show, our appointment sets show closed. Okay. But that's one thing, we just reched, for those are things. that anybody's want to track on a dashboard on a daily basis, because that's, you know, the template that leads to the results that Ryan's talking about, was it the stats? Yeah. So operations that there's that within the membership, there's that with the personal training, too, right? Okay, yeah. So we'll get into that, I'll remember to bring that up with Robbie, uh in the operational side, while we' deep deep dive a little bit deeper into this stuff. You'll hear the terminology. It's a little bit different depending on who you talked to, but we call it set show clothes, right? So it's that init that's the attract and acquoir component where it's if you can actually gilt them from the point of just a lead in the funnel to that next step of setting an appointment and that they actually show for the appointment, and then you actually close by selling them a membership, right? Those are kind of the three steps that we track from an acquisition standpoint. And then, what we have a report just generically called Jim Stats that we'll get into that is kind of the membership sold revenues associated in gym sale. It's a myriad of stats that's kind of a one pager per gym, and then we've got our Power VI dashboards that are a little bit more higher level for district manager and above level, a way up to Danny, even up to some North America KPIs that are shared with Germany and their BI team as well. So we'll dig into all those. So going forward, I see kind of like It's also top of funnel 2 as well, right? Yeah. Yeah. So it leaves. It's what leads. It's what leads to. It's what leads into the sets, which is the leaves. Yeah, that's where, in my opinion, like, if we're not going to be large sales force in their gym, which we're not, that's where the MAREC piece comes in, where you have to. Yeah, if marketing's not driving leads, then we're just twiddling thumbs and standing at the door in the you know, right. That was going to be my question was, because it sounds like in 2026, there's some question whether it's going to be more sales force driven, like, you know, direct sales, or more like the Thornton Club, which it sounds like, you know, Brad was talking about, like,Gives of the Future, right? Which is they have no salespeople and it's just all self-service people signing up online. Very easy. They have one membership. I think certain markets and certain areas, if you're the only, let me add some color to that. So, these rights, even our gems, Now, unless I have a g where they're just walking in, the door may have an extra salesperson to help, but the marketing's what driving the leads, what we're doing, and what, you know, the Thorn jet will probably the most likely do, too, is we're lavaging the staff we have now, which is our two managers, two takes the tour, to follow up with the leads, to ensure that if someone has an interest in the jam, they're following that prospect's journey to the end, whether it's closing or a no. So we're not adding staff, we're leveraging the staff, we have, we're just now they're finally used the technology to help us identify where there's opportunity, like, where are these leads coming forward, where we gener generating enough? Once they come into the gym, we don't just forget about them. We should be tracking, okay? Did they join? And then when we follow up, it might be a marketing push notification that follows them up, but overall, the managers have an idea of what's driving in the members and doing their part to help close it. So, again, we're not adding staff, we're just leveraging what we have and the technology will be there to help us identify where are we spending the money to drive the leads. But as the issue of the leads going to the gym, or is the gym just completely poor and the customer service and we're not doing enough there to ensure people are seeing the value of joining us. So those are what we're trying to measure. So he's right, we are streamlining, but it doesn't mean we're getting rid of sell. There still will be accountability on the manager level if people aren't closing and not telling us why. Yeah, our pendulum swung so far to the no sail streamlined when RG first took over. It was no pressure. walking in her gym. Yeah, you can take a tour. I'm not even going to stand over your shoulder. Just go walk around." And if you want to sign up great, if not, we're not gonna pressure you. And I think we're definitely not swinging the pin on all the way back to high pressure sales in large sales teams, but we're definitely moving the needle in the direction of accountability for sales in production in our gyms more than we have been under the initial days of RSG. So we're probably still going to be at the low end compared to a lot of the franchisees as far as what they're doing from a sales pressure standpoint. Gotcha. Okay. Makes sense. So we're looking at systems, it's not, you know, we don't want to look at like a direct sales force, and that's how you guys are going to sell, and we need a good system for people to follow up on calls.'t for Yeah, we recently bought, well, not recently. five or six months ago, Walt the sales module of HubSpot, have our GM, maybe AGMs, a license or two per gym now that has the ability and it's kind of still being developed out by Alex to get the right information in there, but the concept of as leads come in, they need to be followed up. I kind of look at it as while the GMs need to be involved, and there's a human touch that's important. There's also a lot of opportunity for automation around from the point of a lead coming in to follow ups communications, automated text, emails, this, that, or the other, where we can look for technology to drive, especially with agent AI and those things. Like there there's just even the ability for learning models to say this lead is more probable than this lead based on certain things. Let me focus on hot leads versus cold leads. Even if it's just the suggestive nature of the tool in the AI, putting that information in the hands of the GM and the GM is still making the calls and it's not fully automated, right? I think there's just a lot of tech technological opportunities and things out there that we can leverage. And again, back to big picture. best in class, franchisee saying, I want that. That's working. I'm not gonna do it the old fashioned way, I want the new way. Right. And that's where we want to kind of get to. Yeah, makes sense. So one of the things that I drew here as a picture is I feel like there's this box, and I call it a box when I's called gym, and then you have all these tentacles off it all these things that people do, but like, what is the standard, right? 'Cause and where do those things start and stop? 'Cause the MEch side of the equation is a big still sort of open question. Yeah, I mean, we can help formulate that, and again, I I have an idea, obviously, you know, Brad and Danny are gonna have their input and say, and they are driving, for the most part, the direction. But I think collectively, we'll through this process discover that it's probably going to be, we need to own, as we try to today, but not very effectively, because of the different systems, the website, right? That is That is the top of funnel of information and leads coming in. We need to own it in its entirety. So from there, it's, what is my CRM that now can take these leads and start communicating in a sales cadence and follow up? So, to me, it's website, it's CRM That's kind of your top of funnel. Now I'm into whatever the key I buy a membership, you know, is that the Zenoti, the ABC, whatever that core gym management platform is? Obviously, that's the hub with these spokes coming off. CRM continues to be the communication process and the engagement process for journeys throughout the process. PT, possibly, you know, we're looking at this demotu product. There might be others that are taken into consideration down the road, but that's at least the direction the company gyms are going as we discover what others are doing for what we'll call add-on services, right? Whether it's personal training. I think we use PT. He used it in the form of physical therapy earlier. PT, because we're looking at, again, an external solution with an external partner to provide some of those services. But definitely the core... Yeah, go ahead. Hey, guys., I I have to get ready to jump call, so I just wanted to thank God, but I'll see you'all tomorrow. Okay, yeah, I was gonna ask, you coming to town tomorrow, Danny? I'll be in there today, but just until later. Okay. So I'll definitely be in person the rest of this. Okay. I'll reach back out to you and Brad. If you got one more second, we'll probably with these guys in town and Rick in town, all at hotels, we're probably gonna do a dinner. I think that, you know, there's more valuable conversation. And if we've got these guys here, if you guys are available for dinner, and want to join, I'll reach out to you guys separate and see if y'all are available. Yeah. I'll be there tonight and tomorrow night, so just checking to know. I knew I could lure in with me. Yeah. Yeah, no, for sure. Thanks, Danny, guys. Thanks, Danny. Thanks, Danny. Thank you. All right. start? Yeah. Yeah, cool. That's helpful. Yeah. That north start. Yeah, I think. we're gonna have to as much as you guys feel like I need definitive decisions on certain things, um, we'll have to continue to re ask certain questions over the court. I mean, are we going to decide today, like, I need five new people and I'm going to do X,YZ features and functions or whatever. I know that, you know, Brad's obviously still learning the business. He's only been with the company for a couple of months. I' firmly believe that there's going to be some things that just makes sense. Like, if all of this data resides in whatever gym management system we pick, and today, we have buildinging audits. Are all the people that we expect to build actually going out the door and we're building? Are, you know, are they hung up in a process and not going out as they should? They' When we were on Jonas, we had the issues, most often we had the issues. Everybody, I guarantee you, has issues with, are you billing 100% of the members you should be billing? Probably not for different various reasons. Some of it could be technical issues that need to be fixed within the system. Some of them are probably configuration where, oh, you accidentally flipped this guy to this status and didn't realize it and they're stuck in No Man's Land with the next billing date that's now advanced and it's stuck back here and it doesn't know to catch itself up or whatever, right? To me, probably an overarching collections probably should be. We use an external partner for collections, but it's still owned and managed internally. The relationship and some oversight and auditing of that. To me, different from, I believe, the world that Brad's lived in, you know, most recently, like at Shipley's Donuts where he came from, where it's a point of cell system, right? You're not reaching back out to a member to say, I need to collect that additional 50 cents for that donut that you didn't pay for, right? Everything's a paid and full transaction in a point in sales system. This is a recurring business model that I think he's still learning some of the nuances of that long term contractual relationship and all the things that that entails. a lot of customer care. Yes. So again,, it's not the restaurants's a lot more transactional. One and done.. You know, it done, right? Now, there's still customer loyalty that comes into play, whether it's, you know, hotels, restaurants, what have you. But it's different, right? And, you know, again, if somebody, if I'm sitting in his shoes and somebody says, do we need a customer care department and a call sitter, you know, with 40, 50 people and, you know, no, we don't want to, that's not what we want to do. But again, I believe somewhere in that gray area, we'll figure out, like, you know, like what we own, what we don't own, and how we make sure that we're not just pulling the rug out from underneath them and saying, we don't offer this, so they're never going to want to jump into it because they don't want to hire a 15 new people to do all those things themselves. Well, that's why I push the envelope just a little bit there to say, and he needed to go. I's, "We don't know yet. He's looking for the best in class, suggestions.We all know that the personas in this business. They're not tech people and they're not all business people. They're fit people. Right. So there's going to be time. The only question I didn't ask is what brands does he think are best in class in fitness? I think it's okay to ask that. I think he's probably going to say, you know, I don't know what I don't know. I mean, I think they've learned and Danny's done a lot of research on the competitors such as Crunch. We have former employees that have moved on, I think Danny still has contact with, that he can tap a little bit here and there to understand their, you know, the behind the scenes. But I think part of you know, one of the things Brad said early on, just for you guys to keep in mind was, you guys are the experts, right? And so he's saying, you tell me what what are what do you guys believe are the best in class out there based on what you know? But I think they're folk. Some of it's subjective, right? I mean, it's an opinion. And he's wanting to say, you come to me and say, you know, here's these three things. And he'll be like, yeah, I like this one. He doesn't want to start and be part of the entire process of the build. He wants, put some stuff in front of me and say, "This is what we believe is your best options as part of the process, and he's making directional decisions on some of you guys' expertise in what you know and learned over the years, right? He definitely wants the copy paste. That's. That's what I' I remember from that. conversation was I was trying to get him to lean in and say a lot of things that he he finally did that one meeting with us. I couldn't. Yeah, did a good job. I thought of narrating, you. Yeah, I agree the paper pictures. Nothing even specific, you know, dollars and cents, goals, but, yeah, he realizes it's going to be a five-year plan, but I think if we all look at our competitive brands, do we copy what plan is doing? I don't think we can. But there's nuggets of what planet does really well that we may consider, but we look at the crunch, we look at the anytime, you look at those that are franchising really well as probably the key indicator, to go and figure out what are they doing that makes them franchise well, which goes back to the playbook, goes back to the turnkey, goes back to right. Okay, well then how do they implement such a really good turnkey tech stack and playbook and whatever kind of everything thing does that? My thought process were in there probably some rub in you can speak to this more, Matt is that most of those guys are investing more in franchisee support than corporate support, and I think he's trying to hold this, right? And just something like very small incremental. Yeah, I have support. I mean, to me, it's one of those things that we've got 50 company owned gems. We've got, whatever, 150 domestic franchisees, roughly. Let's say it grows to 200 within a year, a year and a half. Whatever we choose is, this is how we're going to operate. These are the assistance we're going to operate on, the people that we have that already support the 50 company gyms and most of the people that support them used to support 165 when we were at that level. We've changed our footprint a little bit with staffing. To me, it's like.. the same, like the point I made where we' like, fucking Glowfox can't even do more than one billing because they're out of Ireland and just trying to break into the U.S and they chose them for whatever reason, because it already had a built-in app attached to it, and John Reed needed that, and RSG was acting as a startup, basically trying to open these gems. They purchased golds. Now they have this entire back office support, and you know, within a few months, I was like, I hope I'm not digging my grave here, but I'm like, glow fox sucks. Resort Suite is a fucking shit show that you guys have been working on for 2 plus years and the club's still under construction It hasn't opened. I'm like, I believe that we can take both of these, plug them into exactly what we're doing in motion soft and have everybody operating in the same manner. And even though JaimA is this upper end at the end of the day, you're selling a membership, we're selling it slightly different. They have to go through an approval process. It's more like a country club. You got to get approved, kind of thing. But at the end of the day, you just bought a membership, and there's services and amenities and appointed sale that you can buy stuff, right? So the operating model is not that different. So if we can say, this is our operating model on whatever new systems, I don't think you do need a lot of additional people, because the people that are doing it here for 50 gyms that were the same people doing it for 150 gyms, slap on 50 more, 100 more, 200 more. It's not. I mean, it's very scalable as long as everybody's running a similar play. And, you know, I've been trying over the last few months to, from an outsider looking in the best I can, Tracy and I were ordering a pizza the other day, and you'll meet her, she works with Billing. And I was like, I was looking at dominoes, and I said, okay. It says, you know, their deal of the week or the month or whatever was 50% off all pizzas, regardless of what kind of it is, 50 off. And I'm like, are they consistent? Is this a national marketing? Is this across the platform? Or is there all these fragmented franchisees out there? You know, I get it, you see participating franchisees or whatever. So I plugged it in, you know, my local zip code, and we ordered it, and it was, whatever, it was like an $18 pizza, 50 off, it was nine something, and change, whatever. I'm like, okay, let me go through that process again. I'm like, all right. The only California Zip code I know is 90210 from the stupid show back in the day. So I plug in 90210 and exact same offer, 50 off. Pick exact same pizza. The difference is, I think it was $2 or $3 dollars higher. So even though the base offering in that particular market was more expensive, the offer was still $50 off, right? We can have different price points. We can say that you know this California market or this New York market or whatever has all these different price tiers because of amenities or just local market I mean, DC is that DC market, I mean, they're charging 60, $70. I forget what they're charging, but like. T charging. Yeah, they were charging more than SoCal was charging when, you know, like, that's crazy. I mean, DC is a highly assault in, you know, a very consolidated market or whatever, but I'm like, we weren't charging anywhere near that, and we own those DC gyms before we sold them off. So however, they have evolved to say in elasing that local market, the brand notoriety and recognition and the ability to demand, and they do have three or four new gyms that they've opened the last few years. So they do have some very, like, strong, like, good looking gems to walk into, along with some, you know, the older ones that are beat up and warped, you know, floors in the in one of the rooms. But again, like, if we can get to a point where we can say, your ideas are welcome, they'll always be. Every month, when we talk about the franchise team and Kevin or whatever, maybe they'll talk a little bit about it. But right now, we do have a national offer that we put out there, and we have to figure out it's usually a certain dollar amount offer a percentage, because we can't just dictate a price point because price points are so different, it doesn't make sense. I think our adoption rate of how many people actually participate in that national offer is probably, I don't know, 20%, maybe I'm wrong, but if I understand it correctly from Melie over the years, it's like most people are like, me, I don't even want to do your play? Because we know our market better. We're going to do it better. And that's where we've got to, I think a big thing is convincing them that corporate America, you know, corporate goals Jim can actually do things well, because we've never been structured to do things on their behalf, the few times that we've had leadership say, "Oh, we need to go to this year's convention and we need to unveil a new model, and we're gonna have these breakout sessions where we know how to train people the best to tell them what to do. We don't, we never have. Our full focus has always been company gyms, and we threw a couple of things out there over the years of we know best. And a few people adopted it and, you know, most of them were like, nice bullshit or didn't want it or we would come up with the studio concept. We had Goldspit, Goldsb, and one other gold cycle, right? So it was combating like your soul cycles, your CrossFits, and Vern was kind of like your orange theory. Branded studio concept, signage, you know, everything marketing did that was like, but then it was, oh, and we have programming. Within a year or so? No, we're not doing the programming. Our headperson over cycle, I think, got let go or moved to a different company and it just slowly dwindled. So they have lost faith that we can push something out to them as far as the best practice. So the concept of saying, your entire livelihood, everything you do today, not just an operational concept such as Gold Studio, but your entire operating model, the systems that you run on, were asking you to trust us and move to this. I mean, if it fails, it's you know, it fails for us, it fails for them. I mean, it it's detrimental to the brand to not do whatever we can do to get this right and make sure that we are best suited. Again, it's not all about manpower, but to make sure that we support it and own it as the franchise or, we have to own this 100%. It can't just be a Here's a concept push it out the door, but we're still going to kind of go do our own thing." Since this website's an issue, what's actly being done on it right now? I think it's a good point discovery, you know, when to bring Alex in..C it's probably, like one of the just as government bio, since we have 15 minutes to the. I would say so. We've got two hours back to back, so this suggest a biobreak an hour. Paul really quick. Yeah, I was going to say, because it's like the entry door into this whole thing for everybody's website. Yeah, so the digital, the 11 o'clock, will be with that team. Yeah. And basically, it's an integration with motion soft, because that's what our company gyms are on, so it was the focal front. And then at the same time, it was, but it also needs to talk with ABC because a majority error franchisees aren't ABC. Anyone else, it can be pick a gym that's not on one of those platforms, it can do a link to hop off to their own joint online, if whatever system they're on has a joint online. But even the ones that are on ABC, I think probably only three or four have been actually on board with the full integration. Some of them still have a jump off point, like DC Metro, I think, still jumps off to their own website in the ABC Joint Online link that they have and use. So they're trying to transition people, but it's a slow process, just for a lot of reasons. So all the marketing is driving the goldsym.com? No. And then. Oh, yeah. And then the transaction, the checkout is some specific, yeah. So they're not investing they' investing marketing dollars and they're local. They are, and a lot of them have just said, despite what you're trying to do for the overall brand, there's just and I agree. There's aspects of local more, even for us, like Austin, San Antonio, Oklahoma, you know, localized marketing can have better results than just Most of that local ones I have been is than being driven personal websites they're building, 'cause it sounds like everybody's building a personal website right now. A lot of them are yes. Like if everyone I've talked to, everyone has one. Yeah. And a lot of them, I won't say that they Yeah, some of them have their full blown website. A lot of them just have a what I would call more of a. a micro site or a landing page that gets you to the joint online, right? Because they realize, especially, you know, COVID fast forward a lot of things, the ability to do things digitally became very, you know, prevalent and important. So all right, yeah, let you guys take a breather. Coffee, water, bathroom, whatever you need. Sounds good. Have a good 15 minutes.
