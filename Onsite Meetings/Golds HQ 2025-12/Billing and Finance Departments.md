**GOLDS Billing and Finance Departments 2025-12-09**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Franchise and Company-Owned Gym Accounting Processes:**

Kerry and Teams Hub 1 discussed the accounting responsibilities for both franchise and company-owned gyms, covering revenue recognition, bank reconciliations, and the division of duties between their teams, with Tracey providing additional details on royalty and fee collection processes.

- - **Revenue Recognition and ASC 606:** Kerry explained that their team handles all accounting and financial reporting, including revenue recognition for franchise revenue in accordance with ASC 606, where initial fees are deferred over the term of the agreement and the process is currently manual.
    - **Bank Reconciliations and Expense Matching:** Kerry described their responsibility for performing bank reconciliations and ensuring expenses are captured according to matching principles, maintaining accuracy in financial records for both company-owned and franchise gyms.
    - **Royalty and Marketing Fee Collection:** Tracey detailed the process for billing franchisees for royalties and marketing fees, including the use of FRANCONNECT for domestic franchisees, manual spreadsheet management, loading data into Great Plains, and drafting payments via EFT, with additional efforts required for international franchisees.
    - **Reporting Deadlines and Exceptions:** Teams Hub 1 clarified that franchisees are required to report by the 10th of each month, but some require reminders or have exceptions such as delayed drafts or payment plans, especially in special circumstances like post-COVID adjustments.
    - **Division of Accounting Responsibilities:** Teams Hub 1 emphasized that, per direction from Danny and Brad, the central accounting team is not responsible for all franchisee accounting functions, but does provide oversight, monitoring, and auditing to prevent revenue loss, while franchisees may use their own systems like QuickBooks.
- **Member Billing and Collection Processes:**

Teams Hub 1 outlined the member billing processes for corporate-owned gyms, including invoice generation, collection cycles, decline management, and integration with external collection agencies, while discussing automation and reporting needs.

- - **Billing Cycles and Invoice Generation:** Teams Hub 1 described the use of various billing cycles, honoring inherited agreements from acquired locations, and ensuring invoices are generated and sent for all members, with daily billing and tracking of collections.
    - **Decline Management and Collections:** The team tracks decline rates, identifies types of declines, and cancels memberships for non-payment after 90 days, at which point accounts are transferred to an outside collection agency, with Motionsoft automating reminders and batch cancellations.
    - **Corporate and Group Membership Billing:** Corporate sales involve discounted memberships sold to companies, with billing directed to the company rather than individual members, and processes for enrollment, cancellation, and auditing managed through a homegrown portal integrated with Motionsoft.
    - **Automation and Reporting Enhancements:** Recent improvements include allowing company admins to manage enrollments and cancellations online, reducing manual workload, and the development of reporting tools to ensure all members are billed and to track collection performance.
- **Technology Stack and System Integration:**

Teams Hub 1 and Kerry discussed the current and future technology stack, including the use of Motionsoft, Great Plains, AWS-hosted portals, and the need for integration, automation, and eventual migration due to software sunsetting.

- - **Homegrown Portal and API Integration:** The team built a custom portal on AWS that integrates with Motionsoft APIs, allowing companies to manage memberships, pricing, and cancellations, with configurable options for different company needs.
    - **Banking and Payment Routing:** Kerry explained the use of HSBC's virtual accounts for each gym, with Motionsoft and merchant providers like Fireserv supporting flexible banking arrangements, and the ability to change banks as needed.
    - **Manual and Automated Data Flows:** Currently, data from Motionsoft is manually summarized and entered into Great Plains for accounting, with some daily processes automated via spreadsheets, and plans to move away from Great Plains due to its upcoming sunset.
    - **Deferred Revenue and Recognition Automation:** Kerry described manual processes for deferred revenue recognition, including capturing transaction dates and allocating revenue across periods, with some automation achieved for specific reports but gaps remaining for certain membership types.
- **Standardization and Oversight of Accounting Structures:**

Teams Hub 1 emphasized the need for a standardized general ledger (GL) structure, consistent revenue categorization, and oversight to prevent inconsistencies across franchise and company-owned gyms, with Kerry and others discussing the challenges and solutions.

- - **Common GL Structure Implementation:** Teams Hub 1 advocated for a common GL structure defined by Kerry's accounting team, requiring both new and existing franchisees to align their reporting and categorization for consistency across the brand.
    - **Revenue and Membership Categorization:** The team discussed the need for layered revenue categorization (e.g., membership, personal training, ancillary revenue) and the use of budget categories and subcategories to enable detailed and flexible reporting.
    - **Oversight and Audit Mechanisms:** To prevent the proliferation of inconsistent item definitions and revenue buckets, Teams Hub 1 proposed oversight, audit controls, and defined roles and permissions, balancing flexibility with the need for data integrity.
    - **Vendor and System Guardrails:** The group considered leveraging vendor relationships to enforce guardrails and normalization, ensuring that system configurations support standardized reporting and prevent the creation of redundant or misnamed items.
- **Franchisee Support, Best Practices, and Consultant Roles:**

Teams Hub 1 described the role of franchise business consultants (FBCs) in supporting franchisees, sharing best practices, conducting audits, and ensuring adherence to operational and accounting standards, with plans to involve them in upcoming system changes.

- - **FBC Responsibilities and Regional Coverage:** Franchise business consultants are assigned by region to mentor, audit, and support franchisees, ensuring compliance with brand standards, assisting with gym openings and closures, and addressing operational challenges.
    - **Sharing Best Practices and Performance Metrics:** FBCs conduct audits, compare franchisee performance to company averages, and provide actionable insights and best practices, such as managing decline rates and optimizing billing processes.
    - **Involvement in System and Process Changes:** The team plans to involve FBCs in the transition to new systems and processes, leveraging their role as ambassadors to communicate changes, gather feedback, and ensure franchisee alignment.
- **Future System Requirements and Configuration Considerations:**

Kerry and Teams Hub 1 discussed requirements for future gym management systems, including sales tax handling, configurable membership and revenue categories, and the need for flexible yet controlled configuration to support reporting and analytics.

- - **Sales Tax and Revenue Grouping:** Kerry highlighted the need for any new system to support sales tax components and layered revenue grouping, distinguishing between types of revenue such as new memberships, recurring dues, and retail sales.
    - **Configurable Membership Buckets:** The team discussed the importance of configurable membership and revenue buckets, allowing for both high-level and detailed categorization to support various reporting needs.
    - **Normalization and Change Management:** Teams Hub 1 identified normalization of data and configuration as a major change management challenge, emphasizing the need for accountability, audit, and clear ownership to maintain consistency across the organization.
- **Usage-Based Memberships and Partner Billing:**

Teams Hub 1 explained the processes for managing usage-based memberships (e.g., Silver Sneakers, Optum Renew Active), including auditing enrollments, submitting usage to partners, and handling partner payment and revenue allocation.

- - **Enrollment Auditing and Usage Submission:** The team audits new enrollments daily to ensure correct categorization, submits monthly usage reports to partners, and posts partner payments to the appropriate gym accounts for accurate revenue allocation.
    - **Partner Negotiations and Centralized Submissions:** Negotiations with partners have led to some requiring a single usage file and payment for the entire brand, which would necessitate collecting and consolidating data from all franchisees, though this has not yet been fully implemented.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Franchisee Reporting and System Integration:** Compile and refine a comprehensive list of current corporate processes and tools, and compare them with franchisee processes to identify best practices and gaps for system integration. (the team)
- **Revenue Recognition for Paid-in-Full Direct Bill Programs:** Review and improve the process for accurately recognizing revenue for paid-in-full memberships in the direct bill program, considering proration and contract end dates. (Kerry, Teams Hub 1)
- **Configuration and Control of Revenue Categories:** Define and implement a standardized GL structure and revenue category configuration to ensure consistency and prevent duplication or mislabeling across all gyms and franchisees in the new system. (the team)
- **Vendor Selection Criteria for Banking and Billing:** Develop a list of key questions and requirements for potential gym management system vendors regarding banking flexibility, billing processes, and integration capabilities. (the team)
- **Automation and Oversight of Member Billing and Collections:** Determine which member billing and collection oversight processes can be automated and which require manual intervention, and establish clear responsibilities for corporate and franchisee teams. (the team)
- **Franchisee Support and Best Practices Sharing:** Establish a process for providing franchisees with reporting, best practices, and performance benchmarking (e.g., decline rates), without taking on their full accounting or billing responsibilities. (the team)
- **Direct Bill Portal Expansion for Franchisees:** Assess the feasibility and requirements for expanding the direct bill portal and related integrations to franchisees, including potential duplication or adaptation of current systems. (Teams Hub 1)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

high level and then we dig in So let's do this. Carrie, Kind of give us, you know, like, we met with the operational team and we talked about like, you know, what each of their roles and responsibilities and what they do within the franchising world. So obviously you kind of have the overall accounting oversight. Tell us what that means as far as, you know, obviously the company owned gyms, but we also call up Tracy's team also collects money for franchisees, so there's probably some amount of revenues that you see coming in from the franchisees that you have to worry about for tax returns and all those things. So tell us a little bit about each of your roles, I guess, and then we'll kind of jump in from there. I'm sorry, let me hit the record button by. You're going to blank out here, you have to come back here. You'll have to authorize it through undersign, sorry. To protect the innocent. No cameras, no voice. Oh, yeah. All right, he's back. You've agreed to these terms. Yeah, um, okay, so are we talking just franchising or are we gonna go into the gyms? We want to talk about. both areas responsibility in what your role in team's role play in both sides of the house, company owned gyms. as well as franchise responsibility. Okay, so we handle all things accounting, all financial reporting. So my core function is to deliver timely and accurate financials. Revenue recognition, we are abide by ASC606 for franchise revenue, our initial fees are deferred over the term of the agreement right now, that is a manual process. Royalties. Tracy probably can speak more to that, so I'll let her talk to about that one, but for our part, we're doing our bank reconciliations and making sure that we're capturing our expenses, according to matching principles. So, I don't know, Tracey, you want to talk about the process of g gathering the grocery receipts and invoices, batch settlements, and such? For the franchise? Yep. So my department is responsible for billing all of our franchisees for their royalties and their marketing fees. Our domestic franchisees report in FrC Connect, so it automatically calculates based on the type of agreement we have with them. We go in and we pull that reporting. We load it into a different spreadsheet. So there's some manual in here for sure. based on whether they've got credits or what have you, we then take it formated, load it into Great Plains, that post the invoice, and then if they have EFT on file, which they all do, and they're all supposed to if they're domestic, I draft the royalties on the 15th and the 25th, just kind of depending. Anything that declines, we have to reach out attempt again. Our international, they are in the process of getting in FranConnect to report. We probably got half of them already in FrConnect. We aren't able to draft them. obviously, because it's international in banking. so we do have to chase that money down. If they're not reporting in FC Connect, they're still reporting to us manually, and we keep up with that in a spreadsheet as well. From what the calculations are, we load and post into great planes, and then that's what we use to collect balances from. That's at pretty high level, but that's the problem. When you talk about a one system, one of the things that I've heard over and over talking to other platforms where the franchise or and the franchise are in the same platform, you're able to get those receipts. whenever you want. From the system, because you're using the same systems. So now when do they have to report by the 10th? They're required to report by the 10th. Okay. For the most part, they do, we do have to chase down, we have to remind. I've got a couple of franchises that are probably six months behind. So if they're not reporting, I typically, I will draft the minimum requirement, and then once they do report, I draft the difference. If there's a difference. And ref Frenchisees is required to have an on draft account to draft from. Yes. And in the past, they haven't always had that, for whatever reason, right now, all of them have a means for me to draft them. So it's minimum or calculation based on import, whichever's crater. And I know we've talked about this a couple times. Part of it is just the curiosity, but like, Eduardo or the French has team's involvement of the nuances of do this, don't do that. Why are they involved? How are they involved? Iorto? Whoever. So a lot of times to the normal they'll reach out and say, "Hey, can you push my draft to later in the month? Okay, so I'll move them to the 25th, or and it doesn't happen as often, but sometimes you stay at way more than it does now. Some I would get notifications, hey, hold off on drafting them for the next six months. They're trying to get some finances in order, so I'm posting the revenue. I just can't go after the balances. And then, once that time comes, sometimes it's easy to collect balances, sometimes the balances are so large, and now we've got payment plans and and whatnot. But we don't have as many of those now as we used to, but it used to be crazy. And that doesn't mean tomorrow I won't have them. There's always an exception, hey, I really need a favor. So we kind of have to work there on those as well. Gotcha. So, are there exceptions like, like, I guess changes to the monthly percentage royalty or something like that? Like, oh, we're going to give them a reprieve or something like that. Is there a lot of those? No. It typically follows whatever their agreement is. If it's 3%, 5%. I think, what? Once we got through some of the backside of COVID, where there were a lot of COVID are absolutely horrible, horrible. I won't to talk about manual. Like DC's crazy. I think DC Metro, we offset the positivity of their investment into growth and opening new gyms versus paying some of their fees, where we gave them some allowances. I think where some of the exceptions to the rules. It's not the norm. Right. So as they close to Jim to relocate, I went after marketing fees only and just posted minimums, and then once they open, we start drafting current, and then we set up a payment plan plan to go back and catch up on the ones. At one point in time, they didn't make any payments for gosh, it was over a year. So now I'm drafting a promissory note with interest once a month to get them caught up on their back fees that when they weren't paying. So that's a special circumstance as well, that becomes manual. So to kind of further set the scope, it's my understanding from Danny and Brad that we are not trying to be the accountants or all things accounting department for the franchisees. We're not trying to necessarily be the entire building solution as you do for the company gyms as well. So as we think through are not, well, TBD on some things, but his initial, like, point of view was, like, if they if they want to use QuickBooks, like, well, we're not doing their whole accounting thing, right? I believe that without billing oversight and monitoring, and auditing, um, just as we've always known, dollars slipped through the cracks and we should be doing those things on the behalf. So I guess that's a TBD part of it is this, I think part of it's a learning curve probably for Brad and Danny to understand the ramifications of not doing those things on their behalf because they're probably not going to do them or have the staff to do them. If we went to one system, their memor billing would be in the same system, ours would, correct? Correct. So are you talking about just from when you get my close revenue? So a couple of things. try to go back. We're not trying to be the entire accounting team. We're not going to do everything for them, right? That's still their responsibility. Instead of manually reporting, we will now have insight into their data because they're all in the same system. That helps for accuracy on making sure we're getting from the franchise is what we're supposed to get to. Now you look at the size and business that you do for the company gems. So talk through some of those responsibilities of billing oversight of members, not franchisees, and would those things be carried over and applied to and done on behalf of the franchisees members, as well, right? Does it make sense? Before you dive into that, all the franchisees are like gross receipts. It's not like some kind of net. It's gross. Okay, got you. Yes. Gross. So we're charging royalties on uncollected dollars, too? Mm hmm. Okay. And is it cash collected, or is it billed? you know, cash accounting or accrual? Is it like what they should? When you calculate the royalty, is it what they should have collected and billed or what they actually collected? It's what they should have. built and collected. Okay, so like in a cruel kind of basis. Yeah. Gotcha. That's what it's supposed to be. I. Are you sure? Yeah, it's gross revenue. They're supposed to report on gross revenue. Not what was collected, but we know that that's not always true. And that's my recollection for. Okay, look, I was just say for us, the financials that we publish, we're cash basis. Correct. On our financials, so I would expect that I would expect that our French is the same. But if they're reporting gross to generate the fee calculation, we report on a cash basis of the fee in which we collect. That would be. So we're Well, at Buo and I have had this conversation many times. There' agreement says, gross revenue, regardless of what you collected on. Yeah. The gross revenue determines the fee in which the calculated fee in which they pay. Yes. So we then, our accounting on our side, is cash basis based on what we collect, based on a projection of their growth. Does that make sense? Totally. Yep. Yep. Okay, so for our member billing, corporate owned members, I don't have to do that manually anymore, so that's a good thing, but it's it's basically, we have different bill cycles because we have inherited when we purchased other locations, we've always tried to honor their existing agreements. We build basically every day. There for a while, we did a lot of beekly and I kind of wish we would go back into that. But my responsibility is we have this many members. First of all, did they get an invoice? Was it generated? Did it go out for collections? Did we collect it? If not, why? We track decline rates. We look at what type of declines they are. At 90 days, we cancel them for nonpayment and then they are picked up by an outside collection agency and the first 90 days, motion soft is we've got it set up. We're sending automatic phone calls and emails, reminding them to pay we do some texting from time to time once they reach the 90 days. We have reporting that we've written, pulled that will identify those members that need to be canceled. We can batch cancel them in the system. They don't it doesn't happen automatically. It would be nice if we could go in and configure something, so at 90 days, it just did it for us, but at least we're able to batch it. We had notes. It's picked up by our outside collection agency, which is currently Aldis. We stay in sync, our balances, if we collect money, they find out and update it on their side, if they collect money, if they post it into our system so that our balance is typically should always match. Then there's the corporate system. That's our retail members, then we've got. Well, I guess it's corporate and root break, but we have a corporate sales department where they go out and they sell discounted memberships to companies. So they walk into Golds, we'll just say ABC company, we're going to offer your employees a discounted rate. They can either payroll, deducted, and then they send the money in, sometimes as a benefit, but we don't collect from the member, we're collecting from the company. So I have two people that do that. The billing is generated, it rolls over to the company, the invoices that we have written a program. It's not happening out of motion soft. We send them out on such and such day out the month. It's a net 30. Some of them have EFT on file, most of them do not. So then we spend the next 30 days collecting auditing. Oh, I forgot to tell you, Susi left the company, just different things where we'd have to go back and do credits or audits. That's high level, because we have some accounts that are pretty difficult. We recently, probably a year and a half ago, prior to that, my team was also responsible for all of those enrollments and cancellations for those direct fill company memberships. We finally got them on a they can go online now and roll, and then the admens of the companies can go in and cancel. So that's taken a lot of work off of my team so that they can do other things. And to kind of paint the picture there, right, you got the V toB relationship.Hey, our normal rate is 40 bucks, but for you, your company's gonna get $30 memberships. You can pay for it on their behalf. You can deduct it from their payroll system, where they're still paying for it, but ultimately, we're billing you as a company for the members that sign up. Employee use the company, doesn't think about their goals gym membership, it's not a direct with us, it's kind of through the company. The only way we know to cancel these members is that the company tells us, right? Where they optped out of it, because they no longer want it. So, yeah, there used to be manual processes, teams of people, literally taking the intake, emails, and canceling. They now, the company now has an admin portal for their HR representatives to say, oh, these people love the company. They had a membership, cance, cancel, cancel. That flows into our system, so they stay in sync and communicate. It's a joint online, so the members can go to their specific company link and join that links them to the company and that special offering, and all that kind of stuff. That's all linked to Mosa. That is is integrated through Moso APIs, it is a homegrown portal and interface that we. just speak briefly about the text stack, of how we've had to create that interface, the service, the database. I mean, these guys may want to know how you've created that. Yes, I mean, basically, it's a homegrown interface sits on AWS. It is a combination of the main configuration portal that says, create a company within the portal, link them back to the appropriate agariement for that company in Moos so it knows ultimately had to talk back to Moso, but this portal that they have admin and rights to allows them to create the company, associate the membership that are available, add certain little price price points, notes, banners, and key things that are informational specific to the company, the company specific agreement language, which is slightly different from retail. Configurations to say, not only can they join online, but for this particular company, we're going to flip the switch and allow them also to cancel online. What are other? I had a family member. Add a family member, a flip switch. You can turn off or on. Different various. configurationable components that we built that ultimately manage what can be done when they join online, it's calling them motion soft API to create them the motion soft, because that is our memor management system where they will be assigned what they dues are, how much they're going to be charged per month, roll the responsibility of those invoices to the company. So ultimately, the company will be responsible for paying it, and you typically invoice them versus a direct draft. So all of that is done initially in motion soft, how we set it up. The price points are now linked to the agreement, the agreement is set up so it knows to roll it over to the company. Add the gems. Once that's done, we have to go into the portal and basically do the same thing. So we've got it all set, we can use the same bundles, the same pricing. If they come in and say,Oh, we've got a special offer and we're going to do $222. I don't have that price point, so I have to start from scratch, in motion solved. Do the linkage, add the gems, through the agreement, to the company, and then do the same thing in the portal. So that's About how many companies do we ser? A little number four, 450, maybe? So, 450 different companies, Ideally, you would think that you could say, these 100 companies, because of their size and potential to add, you know, people to our, you know, as goals members, we're going to give them this price point. This is a smaller company that only has 50 employees. You're not going to get quite the great rate as this larger company. And that's kind of.. So you can reuse those price points across the 450 companies, but instead, we probably have how many different price points? Oh. severaleveral hundred. Yeah. Back in the day, they were pretty much. They could go do whatever they wanted to do, and we just had to make it work. But it wasn't online. And we didn't necessarily, we weren't in motion soft, so it wasn't agreement driven. Some of these accounts we've had for 20 plus years.. So Company A might have a deal at $29.99 a month, some of them are $19.99. And then you'll have $29.98, a penny difference. Could we have not just use the same price point?95.. Yeah. We call this homegrown problems. Yes. But back in the day, they were allowed it was sell, sell, sell, if they sell it, you make it work. So that's what we've done. But tons of price points that we have to keep up with. So today's advancement is we give the business a landing page for their employees to go and sign up through the APS and everything else. So it is another joint online through the direct bill. So if you if you hear a direct bill, you, join online, whatever, you know, from her group, any other conversation, I understand that that's unique to the Jo Online, for the retail site, things. We're moving the corporate group ranked, so it's still a corporate offer that they will sell to a company. Please help us promote this, but a group rate, the members are responsible for paying instead of the company. So, you get the discount, but you actually get billed. Yeah, so we're incorporating them through this same portal. It's a little more complex because we have to collect credit card information, which we're kind of we're in testing phase right now. We haven't rolled it out, but it will be on the same portal at some point. So we'll have to do the same thing with the other companies, but I don't think it's going to be as complex just because I don't think we'll have that many pricing points. So the corporate sales department, which I know we had identified them, Aaron Honken, who runs that department, I can't I don't think she made it in this round of meetings, these two days or not. But she will be a very vocal voice on what her line of business brings to the table and has the potential to bring to the table through direct bill relationships with the company, through group rate, through other partnerships that she manages usage based. Ultimately, the things that she wants to do and has approval to do come down to responsibility of a team that ultimately has to bill and manage them, right? So she's got this involvement of all that. Carrie's got the overall accounting. So I don't believe that this line of business goes away. We have some franchisees that also do it as well. It went away and announced back. It never went away, but. It didn't get Karen feeding growth. Yeah, yeah. From like a sales team growing it. We just maintained with what we had. Now it was it true that pre-pandemic, it was nearly 50% of our indicome was through the drug bill.. I don't think it was feeling that, percent, but it was, what,8, $9 million? Do you remember Caring? I kind of ask you about this yesterday, but it was for a different reason. like it was very significant prior to, and then COVID hit. Yeah, but it wasn't 55. It wasn wasn't close to 50. 50%. But it was from where we were re-wise to where we are today, just because it didn't have the sales team growing the accounts or managing, carrying and feeding, and slowly they kind of tripled off. we're When we started back up, we were like $3 million, I think, and it used to be seven, eight, nine million. Yeah. I forget. So, and there's a lot of potential if we can get it back where it was for growth. So I don't think it goes away. Point being, and we know other franchisees have similar plays. They don't necessarily have the automated portals. figureigured out like we do. It would be nice to try to get them into the. Yeah, something that we can kind of use across the board. And then that's been kind of a question. I know Aaron wants to push this as a franchise or, here's your potential, here's what can happen. And some of them are doing it. But if we're all in one system and are we using the same portal, does that mean my team is also managing that for the franchisees? As far as setting up companies and, you know, so those are kind of questions for everything. Everything that we've built to date is all about integrations andoso. So she's like, "Can we roll this out for our franchise on ABC?" I'm like, "No, we'd have to basically duplicate the entire thing to say, "If you're any of these gems, you got to call these things. same issues as the Joint Online.. So, again, I don't see going Hawai as a line of business, so I think we will have to rebuild. It's definitely something we need to do. Whatever our new system will be, we'll have to integrate into those APIs to do what we're doing today, and then, again, we're all in the same text act, so it should be somewhat seamless as far as now being able to offer to the franchise. So the reason why I've kind of talked through some of this stuff is because to me, some of the underlying questions are, how responsible for these things is Aaron going to be, is your team going to be? I think I'm a firm believer that we have a common GL structure that's put in place by carrying his accounting team that transcends everyone in a new franchisees get on board with it in existing franchisees that are eventually going to migrate, have to figure out how they shape their business to the problems that Alex was expressing. Well, they call an annual feed this, and they do it this way, and they do it this way. All these different flavors, we've got to have consistency. So when somebody sells something that is personal training related service, that from an accounting standpoint, I can say, this is membership revenue, this is personal training revenue, this is ancillary revenue that falls into whatever other categories we want to collect on. And so, yeah, that common gL accounting structure should just transcend across the entire ori end in whatever system we are. A couple of other. But that goes back to sorry, the people that go in say, I retail team,Oh, I'm going to go create new items. We're starting to sell this new energy drink." You know, you've got, in some states, even water is categorized different from a carbonated beverage. You know, I don't even know if THC drinks and all these other, you know, approved, medically helpful drinks are categorized differently. We can't have people willy nilly going into the system, creating things incorrectly. So today, internally, we have oversight. The team knows the right questions to ask, the right way to configure. So, again, as we think through, where do we draw the lines in the sand is how much is accounting responsible for for billing our retail team when it comes to product, like, you, are we are we staffed as a franchise award? Do other franchise orders do these things on behalf or not? Those are some of the questions that we need to understand how others operate. So real quick, another piece, it falls under the corporate sales. It's Aaron. She has partnerships. We have our usage based members, silver and F, silver sneakers, Optum renewactive. As they're enrolled at the gym, it's we have a lot of turnover at the gym. There's confusion at the gym. My team on a daily basis will audit any new enrollment from the day before. If they were enrolled in silver sneakers, but their ID identifies as silver and Fit, we go in, add notes, they should be you know, we keep it as clean as possible at the end of the month, we'll pull the usage and we submit the usage to the various partners. And then when they've gone through and decided what they're paying, what they're not paying, they will send us a report, saying, here's what you're going to get. We will post those invoices. based on the gym so that the revenues flow to the correct gems, and then we apply the payment accordingly when we get the payment. So And where, when I say post them to the gym, it goes on a company account, like a silver sneakers account in motion soft. But the invoices are generated that we post her gems so that the revenue goods dispersed as it should.. So think about now we're in this global gold gym world where we actually have the ability to go check into a franchise gym, right? If your membership is of a tier that would allow that. and, hey, I'm late, past due. I need to make a pain that. I pay it this gym that I'm more of a guest at. The revenue's collected there, it goes into traditionally, if it was rung up on their point of sale, most people aren't taking cash these days, but if they did, it's in their till to be deposited into the bank later. I've never been involved in a franchise organization where I've had to understand the nuances of taking a payment at a location where they shouldn't get the revenue. I bought a doino's pizza from what I'm pretty sure is a franchise, but it doesn't really matter because I just at a point in time purchase. This is now collecting on past dues at another gym. Do we not allow it? Do other franchiseises allow it and know how to allocate the money? Usage based. I check in to a guest gym versus what is considered their home gym, one of ours. Do I get the revenue for that check in? Did they get the revenue for the check in? Is her team responsible for managing this across the entire organization? Or do we just live in our own world still, as Brad? I think a little bit naively thinks just because he's still kind of like understanding the big picture. These are a lot of those questions I think that like, are gonna shape whether what I don't have happened, my worst nightmare is that we pick some good products as our text stack, and we roll it out, and we come back and go,Holy shit. these all these little things and we have no one to do it, and now suddenly, people that already have their plates, 100% full, are now having to jump through the hoops for another 150 gems because we didn't think through some of these things. And they're complaining to us, you guys are doing what you said you were going to do on our behalf, and we're like, "Wait know we had to do it. You know, I do know that we when we're trying to negotiate with our usage base partners a couple of years ago, a year and a half ago, we wanted to get pricing across the board as a brand. We know that we have different rates than what our franchisees get. We were trying to, and have been successful in a couple of them. The rates for Gold's Gym is this. One of them partners said OK we can do that but we want one file and you'll get one payment. So that meant we were going to have to collect the usage from all of our franchisees. Compile it, submit one usage file, they would pay us, and then we would have to disperse it back out. Never got that far, but that was the expectation from the partners was that we want we don't own all of these files come in. And several of them made the comment that the type of files that they get, they're not cleaned. I mean, I know for a fact that we would have a much better, a cleaner file to submit if we were handling it, but. So that's our members high level. We talked about franchise and royalties. I'm also responsible for licensing and the global vendor program. It's not anything that we track in a system. We get manual reports, calculate what the rebate or the licensing royalty is we load it into Great Plains and then we collect on that product. We invoice and collect. Not near as cumbersome as the franchising side of it, but it is a piece of. piece of rebates from vendors that you. Yeah, and that for this particular project, I't some of that might be out of scope, simply because okay, you bought a bunch of equipment from precore, right? We're not going to have a system, or at least we don't today, that manages that. In the gym management system that we pick and the CRMs and the things that tie to it, probably having to. That's probably separate. But again, I just wanted to throw it out. Yeah, no, no. I mean, we want to turn every stone. You know, Carrie, help us understand in today's world. Each of our gems have their own bank account. or a sub account to a main account? How does that work? HSBC has a program where we have virtual accounts, so if you're looking at a bank statement, it's one bank account. If you're looking at a detailed extract every single location has a virtual account. So today we have it structured where there's a point of sale, which was originally designed to be in the store in the location, taking a payment, and then billing. Over time, they end the store evolved to join online and anywhere else a payment could come from, back office, whatever. So I don't know if you want to get into the details on the other issues as far as tax co payments, but um... right now. I would say this. It would be nice to go back to a system where billing is billing and everything else is everything else. Yes. Just say it that way. Yeah, yeah. In most of all probably won't be in the running to be a contender, so that will definitely, but these will be the questions like of the new vendors, like, how do how do you handle banking? From what you know of motion soft and HSBC, if you so chose to say, I'm going to take the next new gym we build and not have it on HSBC, and have a different banking institution of my choice, is that a possibility, or does Moso allow us to bank differently? The reason for the question is, would we allow, do we have to have a universal account and franchise have these virtual sub accounts to the primary account? Or do we allow them to say, for them, they use Bank of America. They use Wells Fargo, and we use HSBC, and all of those can be configured at every gym level and a system can actually function as such at point of sale and recurring billing to handle agnostic billing across a lot of different players and platforms. I think that's a huge question to have the answers to. My opinion on motion soft and where they can route the money to, as long as you can produce a bank letter that shows that it is in fact an account that is associated with the entity in which you filed for the merchant account ID, then you can have it go to that bank account. It We were with Bank of America prior to RSG acquiring golds. Motion self funded, just fine in the Bank of America. Okay. RSG acquired golds, and Now we're banking with HSBC. No problems making that change. So Five Serve is the underlying merchant account provider, and it's not an issue. Now, it is sometimes a little difficult if you need to make a change, just because over time, you're authorized signers change, people leave, things like that, but that's not material for this part of the conversation. As far as getting the information from motion softft into our accounting software, today that is a manual process, we there's no value ad in doing it daily, so we use a total month report in a summary format to record revenue into that system. The bank reconciliation is not automated, so, we have do have some daily processes where we're pulling in live bank data, but we're doing it all in spreadsheets, and we do those comparisons. Great Plains is our accounting software. There are some add- ins to automate a bank wreck. We were never able to figure out how to make it work.. So that's that's that process. We will be going away from great Plains that Microsoft has analced that they's sunsetting that program in 2029. So I don't know. There's a couple of years away, but it's something to think about. Um. The other thing, key pieces that we think about from our side, um deferred revenue, or revenue recognition. So at least an AR system, whenever we build a member, they're paying for, if it's monthly, they're paying for the next 30 days. So I have to go through a process where I capture every single transaction that we created during the month. So I'm looking for the invoice in the month and paid in the month, and then I have to go through and say, okay, what date were you on? All right, this much goes to the next month. And I have to do that right? Today I do it manually.. Open session liabilities, untrained PT reports, we've got that one automated, finally.. And then we defer enrollment. It's not a big number for us, but It's a different revenue recognition programs source soft requirements. And then you're paid in full, you do the same, right? Um. I don't know how many of those were still selling. liability. It's about, you know, in the heavier months, it's up to about $50,000 a month. It's not a lot. Lower months is low as 30. Are you doing rather than, 12 months? What's that? Are you recognizing the revenue broken out over 12 months? Yeah, on that one, Ian and Kim built me a really nice report for that one, and it gives me the contract terms for every agreement that was sold during the month, so for our retail and group, right? We have a really good process for direct bill, if there's a paid and full on the direct bill program, we do not have a good process for that one, and that's just because.. I mean, Trace, you have to tell me if I'm saying this wrong. I's say their term begins in January, and ends in December. They may add and take away from that throughout the year, but their term still ends in December, right? So anything that I see out of the system is gonna tell me that it's a 12 month because it's at the organization level, but they may have just added this person in June or July, and it really should be six or seven months, you know? So So it should be adjusted caring? Because yes, by default motion soft will automatically push it 12 months. We might team, once it's enrolled, we're supposed to go back and adjust the end date to match the company's end date. And it's supposed to be prorated to get to the company's end date. That we have not been able to put on the portal yet because it is going to be more difficult to do. But yet, we can have a different conversation on that. So we're supposed to It's not a big enough number. artors have agreed with me that it's not material.. I've had the argument with them that the amount of labor it would take gather that information and to do it accurately, it's it's just not worth it. So, right now, that would be kind of a wish list type thing to where all of our paid and full is recognized properly. So I think, again, from Brad's at least initial direction was, we are not taking on the accounting function for franchise gyems, right? So what some of the things that he alluded to where he's reconciling bank accounts from company owned gyms, we have insight into what the point of the gym management system says was sold, so we can probably calculate revenues, which we want to do. But as far as what actually reconciles to their bank and how they do their accounting and what accounting system they use, that's on them, that's not in scope. A lot of our franchiseises, they have their own accounting teams. Yes. Not all. But, I mean, yeah, we wouldn't, I don't foresee us doing that. I don't know any franchise or those kind of services on behalf of franchisees, especially fitness and not even, you know, other industries. Yeah, so I think a lot of what you do. So a lot of my questions were, I know, like from a member billing perspective. It's important to me to know that every member got built. And I don't I have to have a process in place. I need to be able to look you in the eye and say, if every member has built. Did we collect What are our reject rates? Let's track it. It's rising, it's going down. What are the decline rates? That's just my responsibility. If we're billing out of the same system, is that something that we would offer our franchise franchisees? We do this? Would we just. I mean, that's just a question. Is that something that my team would need to help track and provide information they do it themselves? My thoughts are. We because part of what my team does is reporting. And a lot of what we do is provide reports that you need and revenue and all the things Carrie needs and everything everything everybody else needs. Yeah, because I't appreciate it necessarily. Yeah, because you can't just go say, did everybody build? How do I know that, right? So it's like, if we know from the starting point of when we last ran the report, whenever we were running it, I find all members that were already in existence, all new members, and say, these, they're not on freeze, they're not scheduled to cancel in the current month, so therefore, they're not going to build. Whatever all those business or reasons are that we should be able to build a report that says, here's who should bill, Here's a report, or a column to that report that says, here's who actually did bill. Here's whose flagged for Fallout and why. Again, it doesn't matter whether they're doing it for one club or 500 clubs, we should be able to automate some of these things ideally in a numer system to where you might still have oversight and you might still have to help answer questions for the franchisees and B a partner in, you, the subject matter expert. But you're not going through the motions and saying, I need five more people because this is a bunch of manual crap. Right, right. Correct. We've got to get to the point where these things are automated to where we can provide them as a service, right? But it's more of software as a service. Yeah, let the FBCs go in with SOPs and best practices based on information that they have around, hey, we happen to notice.. They do it, they do an before they visit a franchise group anyway. They pull all their financials out from what I stand, and they go in and they show them how they rank two others around the country and to the corporate clubs, and they really try to help them. And if let's say, a prickler group is now at 9% decline rate, whereas our company averages, let's say four or something like that, you know, they should come in with that information armed, but it's not like we're gonna do it for them, but we're going to give them the details and maybe the best practices, and if we are in one system, how do we reduce ourselves down to four? What are our best practices on a daily in our weekly or monthly basis? And you get them to go in and actuate it. And I would say, you know, like we send members to collections at 90 days. I know a couple of our franchisees send it 60, some send it 45, I think one was waiting until 120. If we're going to move to one system, it needs to be configurable so that they have they can manage, I want to do it at 60. I want to do it at one, you know, that would be nice to have. We agree that 90 is the sweet spot. Yeah. But it's just something to consider to think about. And then I use FCS. If you use all this. fine, but we need to have the ability to send wherever they need to go. I mean, that's just right now. That's all automated, all those file transfers and payments and Yeah, it could be better, but it is, it's not something that my team or his team's having to, you know, someone on his team used to do it. It's it's was built by motion solft. It's an extract that's thrown out there. Aldis has an API to go in. Grab it. Anybody that's new, that they'll add, and then same with the payment files, would do the placement file every Sunday, the payment files back and forth, or supposedly daily, because we want to keep that in sync, but it's all through the ABI. Yeah, unfortunately, a lot of this is limitation on motion soft side, or not even necessarily limitation, but just the way motion soft works dictated how we had to do our processes. So in this case, it was, if you need full visibility into AR, here's this AR extract. It's huge. Yeah, as we grow as a company and add members and people that have left five years ago, they still owe $5. Aaron has straight that down a little, though. They have made it a little better. but it's still not. If they download every day and they say, of these 750,000 members in here, I'm only concerned about these 75 that got placed within this last week that hit that 90 Day mark. All this other is worthless crap. So that whole process hopefully gets better with whatever bitter we pick. But again, the point of some of this is to try to understand not just what are the right what are the right questions we need to be asking the vendors when we get to that point, but also, what do we do today to help us formulate some of the questions we wanted to be asking the franchiseise? Like, how do you do this? What is your process for collections? What, you know, just because we need to understand all the nuances of everyone's business to say, if we pick this direction and go with it, but it only fits the bill for 20%, the company gems is what we know, so it's obviously going to we're going to try to solve for that, and we only solve for another 20% of the franchisees and the other 80% are all up in arms, because we totally missed the mark on that. We've got to make sure we're trying to ask all the right questions. So as you think about, I know you've already given me that when we did that preliminary stuff and asked for you guys, we'll probably need to revisit that. refine it, add to it for all the different areas to say, these are the things we do here at corporate, how does that differ from all the things and all the tools that the franchisees use, and then how do we find the best of all the worlds and blend them together for the ideal solution that meets the needs for the most? Right? And to me,'s. I did want to bring up one other thing, so. Within the configuration, I don't know that we need to get really deep into, like, sales tax. There's some things that I think are should be pretty. There has to be a sales tax component into the system that we go with, but then there's some other things like, we were talking about the different membership types. within the system that we're using today, there's a category, a subcategory, and then we have a budget category. And those things are keeping track of it's grouping. What's the type of revenue? So is this new membership revenue? Is this a sale at the front desk? We sold a T shirt. Is this recurring billing? And then absits so there's the budget categoory is keeping track of the type of membership, whether there's those three different ones that we mentioned, retail group rate or direct bill, then we're grouping, right, is this new money, is this recurring dues? Is this coaching, is this front desk? And then there's this other subcategory that goes into a little more granular detail. But whatever system would be, it would need to be able to give us summaries, similar to that. Yeah, that the franchise when they go in and reporting, they have to break their revenue out in the same types of buckets. So I think that's definitely something that we would have to have. Yeah, so, again, we' wasn't trying to go into the details on it, but just something that has that kind of layered inherently built into it to summarize that for us. Yeah, and I think when we were with Jonas that we even had the ability to go more than two layers deep, motion soft kind of took us a step backward with a just a category subcategory that was kind of like, you know, your drivers. The concept of what we call budget category that was invented, I don't know, that Blake base, 15, 20 years ago, almost, is really an internal definition where we look at those categories in subcategories to try to quickly segment our member base into what we call retail EFT, retail PIF, corporate EFT, and corporate PIF, corporate direct bill, usage based. Staff promo kind of scenarios. So if we needed to quickly say, give me all members that meet, which we do quite a bit, like we start off with the broad brush stroke of, I want all retail members. Okay, well, I can easily exclude all these others without getting down to the exact membership sold because I' I have this budget category, I'd get retail EFT and PI. Oh, you know what? I don't care about PI, because they don't they're paid in full and they don't even have a EFT on file. This is an offer that I want for recurring members to try to upsell them to PT or something like that. So that is internally defined by us and we look at the right pieces of information to put them in that bucket, and that's, again, on us in our reporting, on not to say that we couldn't have a field that represents that category, whatever system we choose to define what bucket they fall into. But again, I think most franchisees across the board have similar concepts of wanting to track similar things, but that's definitely an internal thing for us, and if it makes sense to continue that and roll it out, even across the board for their ease and convenience, great, it can be done through, you know That's more of a membership tag kind of concept as opposed to like a revenue transaction bucket. Correct. Yeah. At the membership, yeah, those are more like membership buckets that we put them into versus, you know, you know, apparel, right, falls into, there might be shirts and pants, or this appl, that apparel or whatever, from a gel perspective, maybe all Carrie cares about is it's all apparel and that's what rolls up to at the GL level, but from a retail team standpoint or other aspects, a lot of times, they at least want that two-tered level of, here's the high level bucket falls into. Here's a secondary, more detailed bucket it falls into. But ultimately, I think, yes, the goal is that we define an accounting structure that all people will adhere to and agree to, and we have to make sure that we accommodate to the best of our ability, the abilities to do that. But to your point, when they report, franchisee reports similar to our buckets of revenue, its membership revenue, it's PT revenue. There's probably sub buckets of membership revenues, PT revenues, retail concessions. But even if they keep their existing jail structures, because they have their own accounting systems or whatever, if we have everything tagged unif somewhat the same, regardless of what your GL structure says, it' still falls into this category. I think we could I' just thinking if we're pulling for everybody, the categories would still line up regardless of what their GL system is. bailing or are just interrupt saying, hey, hey, I got something to say? No, I got to go. Thank you guys. All right, thanks, Car. Thanks for looking me on the call. Thanks. Bye. Couldn't quite tell I was a map behind him. I was like, what? What kind of map is that? But it's just the wall. Generally, it starts in the reporting in KPIs and you work backwards until your configuration and those kind of systems. How do you want What's the normalization in reporting, the nomenclature, the other stuff, then it drives back, then, do you have tagging capabilities or is it the GL that drives how it gets named when it comes up to reporting? So I think when we get into the analytics and reporting and overall dashboard, you know, the high level and if we're going to have a franchis or dashboarding, right? I think you work backwards. I mean, there's many times when I onboarded, both upon and Jonas, you had to work from the reporting backwards, right? What do you want to see? What's it going to be called? What's most important to you? Let me show you how to set it up then, so that it reports out properly in that manner, right? You didn't configure first and then do reporting, because then you had to go back and undo everything. So I's So I'm in tune to just being an IT where you have to support all lines of the business, I feel like I can contribute, and talk to a lot of these areas that we've talked to. This one, because of the amount of reporting that we've done, obviously the direct portal on the evolvement there, the reporting for your team, the, the invoice generation thing that we built, all of the things or where, Kim on my team who's responsible for a lot of the configuration of Moso. What I don't want to have happen is somebody says, "Okay, my memberships are structured where I have a first month due, I have a pro rate due. I'm not going to call it a first month. I'm going to call an enrollment fee, right? Even with only one person or Kim Primarily and one or two other people over the years, contributing to creating these items that aren't just an item like a bottle of water or a retail concession item, but the items that you're actually selling, the membership components, the duplication, the redundancy, the, well, I thought I created enrollment fee, but I can't find it, so I'll create another one, and it's name slightly different. We can't have every franchisee to some of the problems Alex alluded to. They call it an annual fee. They call it a yearly maintenance fee, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. We have to set, in my opinion, not just the common GL structure that says, this is a membership revenues that goes to these GLs, fitness revenue, these GL. They've decreed the services. We have to have at least some oversight and audit, so it doesn't become everybody has their own flavor of the exact same bottle of water.. I can tell you. Those are different because UPCs are unique per item and you can't duplicate typically. Working on the data warehouse projects with other brands in the past, that is the death knell for all of them. Everybody creating different skews and different, you, codes for this are names for that, and yeah. So I want to make sure that as Brad says, we're not going to be their accounting team, we're not going to be their entire billing team, there's oversight, you know, Kim on my team and configuration that that continues to be a role that she does, the things you do for billing, the things you carry us for counting, the things that we have to do for BI reporting that need consistency and structure, it can't be. We're all the same system, but it's turns back in the W W West because everybody has the autonomy to go and create and do. There has to be roles and rights that keep them under control, but not so restrictive where they're like, well, shit, I just got this new product in and I can't enter it. Or I want to do this special this week and I can't enter this. So I'll call Kim at 4:00 p.m in the afternoon and say, "Can you add the item?? GGP?" I told a little bit.ility to do stuff like that. But there's got to be control that.. Otherwise, it's just adding the same item for the umpteenth time. Well, we're not going to find a system that perfectly defines those permissions, but what we will have to do is define the guardrails and we'll have to have someone on our side to audit. Yeah. Right? And that's that's what I want to give out. Part of what I want to get out of this process is, you know, while Brad might say, we're not going to be a building team and do all the things we do, building wise for our company gyms, or the accounting functions for the accounting team. you have to have audit and oversight and people that support those functions, or it will become the Wild Wild West, right? And then all of your dashboards, all your FVIs value if you want to come in and lean in and take a look at a group because the FPCs are already taking those numbers and telling a group how well they're doing or not doing against others, why wouldn't we do our own internal analytics and offer help? Our job as the franchise for is to. No, I agree. What we We don't need to push their billing buttons. But if you're at 9% decline. And again, the rest of the brain is at 4%, there's an opportunity there for us to leave. Yeah, I believe we're as a service, it's not mandatory, but if you want these things from us., they're paying technology.. Whether you choose to use the dashboards that we create, do or don't. Point being, though, is dashboard or not, we provide it or whatever, they can't go in and create what I'm going to call it enrollment fee, and then the next one go in and say, this is my.. No, I understand that. You, annual fee, and I'm going to call it this fee, and that fee and that fee, but they all mean the same thing and the reporting doesn't know how to say what is upfront revenues collected versus recurring membership versus an annual fee versus what have you, right? I mean, that to me is, the data has to be structured in a way where they can't screw it up. And that requires either their lockdown or there's oversight and audit and control, and that means... We are the franchise or and we have to own it. What have you guys seen from other franchising here? Do they put that level of auditing gatekeeping, you know They tried to, but the systems don't allow it. And you run into the situation where on a 4 p.m. a Friday, you know, they need to do that. And then you say,Okay, well, we'll open it up. And then you get like 20 definitions of a water bottle. That's. So we're on the hook of either gatekeeping it.. auditing it so close that you're almost need to gatekeep it. I think we also lean in on the bor. Like, let's say we pick aing. I'm just, you know, we lean in on the vor relationship to say, you guys need to help us audit this as well. If you can give us the exact permissions, because they're probably not going to be just perfectly late what we're talking about, where you have flexibility, but you're also within guardrails. You guys need to help us to help hold them accountable to these standards and give them the same playbook that we would have, and we put out there unlike what we have with ABC today. ABC does not run any interference on our behalf. And they admit it, right? Which is why you have what you have is this lack of normalization. Well, and where kind of going back to the digital team conversation, if I have a GL structure that's solid and in place and we clearly define the right revenue buckets that make sense for us as a business collectively, then do I want a clutered system? No. But at the end of the day, if I need I call an API to say, what does this membership in of that I'm going to sell? And they're having trouble picking out what the annual fee is 'cause they named it something different. In theory, if it says item A, item B, item C, item D is what this membership is made of, I really don't care what A, B, C, and D are if they're associated to the right GL. I can generically say this is an upront fee, this is an annual fee, this is this fee, potentially. A lot of times those APIs don't return it down to that GO level, but the point is, this is a very important piece to sol War for the downstream of reporting financials of all the things. It's going to be your biggest change management opportunity is this normalization. And holding people accountable. Yeah, and the accountability or the control and the audit aspect, who owns it, are we doing it all on their behalf? No, are we staffing to do it all for them? No, but without audit in control and the people that probably will take additional people to manage some these things will be will be quickly either reeling from the pain of it, or it'll become the W W West and you know we can't can't have it. So the franchise consultants is that a service in charge for, or is it just like they're a member of reps or account reps or something like that? Is the equivalent of an account rep? So we own in our franchise department what we call our franchise business consultants. They're regional. So you get all the ones in this region or this region, they are yours to babysit, to help to mentor, to help through problems, help make choices. We impose them on end. closure, open closings. Are you up to brand standard? I'm going to walk your gym. You're a prime example of making us look bad, clean your gym, do this better, do this better, you know. Gotcha. Or like the class that I went to last week. They go in and they talk about operational best practices and they hope, you know, that particular franchise group worked through any problems that they see, either in the data or reporting hiring. They talked about a lot of stuff last week, which was really cool and then they talked among themselves to problem sol. And Y'll meet Katie again, you met her one silly stir in initial introductions. She runs the FCs, but she'll be in with the franchise portion of the conversation tomorrow, you, but we're going to lean a lot of them, right? They're going to be our ambassadors, right to a lot of the things that we're talking about here. And if anyone needs to be across the changes well in advance and also be a part of it, it's going to be a herd group, you know, because they're the ones that go and hold the franchise to that standard. They're decideles big time. You know Gotcha.

Yeah, I say I'm not a recorded cause. It's Nice meeting you.. I''m sure I'll see you again. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.. All right, so we got a little bit of a break until the session.
