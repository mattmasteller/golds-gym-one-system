**GOLDS Digital Marketing 2025-12-09**

**Meeting notes:**

- **Data Normalization and System Disparity Challenges:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed with Alex and other team members the significant challenges posed by disparate systems, inconsistent data nomenclature, and varying operational practices across corporate and franchise locations, emphasizing the need for data normalization and standardization to streamline processes and support future initiatives.

- - **Inconsistent Fee Nomenclature:** Teams Hub 1 explained that different franchisees use varying names for similar fees (e.g., annual fees), which complicates integration and onboarding processes, as the system must interpret and adapt to each franchise's unique terminology.
    - **API and Billing Complexity:** The team highlighted confusion arising from diverse billing cycles (monthly, biweekly) and the lack of a standardized approach, which makes API integration and data normalization difficult when onboarding new franchisees.
    - **Back Office Support Variability:** Teams Hub 1 noted that ABC's back office support team must maintain a playbook of rules for each franchise due to inconsistent operational practices, leading to inefficiencies and increased support overhead.
    - **Normalization Efforts and CDP Plans:** The group discussed plans to implement a Customer Data Platform (CDP) in 2026 to help normalize and centralize disparate data, with the CDP acting as a light data lake to support backend infrastructure improvements.
- **Join Online Platform Rollout and Franchise Onboarding:**

Teams Hub 1 and Alex reviewed the status of the Join Online platform rollout, detailing the onboarding process, current backlog, and the operational challenges of integrating franchisees with varying configurations and membership structures.

- - **Onboarding Process and Timeline:** Alex described the typical onboarding process for franchisees, which involves a three-week cycle per franchise: initial discovery, configuration, testing, and go-live, though this timeline is often extended due to the need for custom adaptations.
    - **Outstanding Franchisees and Backlog:** The team identified three franchise groups (Idaho, Richmond VA, and Pacific Northwest) as currently in the onboarding pipeline, with a total of 24 groups outstanding due to the complexity and resource demands of normalization.
    - **Sustainability and Support Limitations:** Teams Hub 1 emphasized that the current hands-on approach is unsustainable, as ongoing support and frequent franchise-specific changes require a much larger team, making it impractical to scale without further automation or standardization.
    - **Mapping and CMS Configuration:** The group explained that franchisees can configure their local gym pages through a custom CMS built on WordPress, but most rely on the central team for updates due to limited technical expertise.
- **Website Redesign and Performance-Driven Features:**

Teams Hub 1 outlined the ongoing website redesign project, focusing on creating a performance-driven, standardized platform that consolidates amenities, membership offers, and booking features, with input from a digital task force and external development partners.

- - **Design Objectives and Standardization:** The redesign aims to standardize amenities and membership benefits across franchisees, ensuring that users have a consistent and compelling experience that encourages engagement and conversions.
    - **Booking and Scheduling Integration:** A new booking feature is being developed to allow users to interact with class schedules directly on the website, though integration is complicated by the use of different scheduling systems among franchisees.
    - **CMS and Technical Stack:** The website operates on a customized WordPress CMS with a MySQL backend, augmented by Airtable as the source of truth for location data, facilitating updates across both the website and mobile app.
    - **Analytics and Performance Tracking:** Website analytics are captured using Google Analytics 4 and BigQuery, enabling franchisees to access dashboards with visitor, free pass, and regional targeting data to inform marketing efforts.
    - **Development Partners and Autonomy:** Development is managed in partnership with STRV, a Prague-based team, with the current internal team having full autonomy over design and functionality, moving away from previous external influences.
- **Franchisee Autonomy and Custom Solutions:**

Teams Hub 1 discussed the high degree of autonomy franchisees have in developing their own websites, apps, and marketing strategies, which has led to a proliferation of custom solutions and challenges in achieving brand and operational consistency.

- - **Custom Websites and Apps:** Over 90% of franchisees maintain their own websites, and there are more than 20-30 different Gold's Gym apps in use, often integrated with their preferred systems such as ABC or Peak, resulting in fragmented user experiences.
    - **Branding and Compliance Issues:** Franchisees' custom solutions often diverge from brand guidelines, including non-standard colors and lack of ADA compliance, exposing them to legal risks and undermining unified brand presentation.
    - **Preferred Vendor Programs:** The organization maintains a preferred vendor program (GVP) but has historically allowed franchisees to adopt new systems independently, later formalizing these choices as needed.
    - **Marketing and Ad Management:** National ad campaigns are managed by W Promote, with franchisees having the option to run local campaigns or use alternative vendors, though the central team does not directly manage performance marketing.
- **Change Management and Future Standardization Initiatives:**

Teams Hub 1 highlighted the importance of engaging with ABC and other stakeholders to drive normalization, discussed the need for clear boundaries on corporate support, and outlined the strategic direction toward a unified tech stack and operational model.

- - **Conversations with ABC Leadership:** The team recounted discussions with ABC's Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, who acknowledged treating franchisees as individuals rather than as a unified brand, and expressed willingness to consider normalization efforts.
    - **Cost and Pricing Implications:** A potential move to a unified ABC system would require renegotiating pricing structures, as economies of scale would lower rates for some franchisees but reduce ABC's overall revenue from the group.
    - **Support Model Deliberations:** The group debated how much operational support the corporate team should provide versus what franchisees should manage themselves, considering options such as fee-based services or outsourcing.
    - **Adoption Strategy and Task Force:** A digital task force of four franchisees provides regular feedback on website and app development, with the expectation that their endorsement will drive broader adoption among other franchisees.
- **Brand Value, Pricing Strategy, and Competitive Positioning:**

Teams Hub 1 reflected on the impact of discounting and pricing strategies on brand value and member retention, referencing industry best practices and the need to balance competitive pressures with long-term brand integrity.

- - **Discounting and Member Engagement:** The team discussed how frequent discounting can devalue the brand and reduce member commitment, advocating for a more consistent pricing strategy to enhance perceived value and retention.
    - **Competitive Market Considerations:** While acknowledging the need to respond to local competition, the group noted that successful brands maintain pricing discipline, which correlates with longer member tenure and stronger brand loyalty.

**Follow-up tasks:**

- **Data Normalization with ABC:** Initiate a conversation with ABC to discuss normalization of data and processes for franchisees as part of change management efforts. (the team)
- **Join Online Franchisee Onboarding:** Complete onboarding of the remaining three franchisee groups (Idaho gyms, Richmond VA gyms, and one other) to the Join Online platform, following the established three-week per franchise process. (the team)
- **Membership Configuration Standardization:** Work with franchisees and ABC to identify and implement consistent naming conventions and configuration standards for memberships and fees to reduce ongoing support and auditing overhead. (the team)
- **Website Redesign Rollout:** Share the new website design with relevant stakeholders and gather feedback to ensure it meets performance and standardization goals before rollout. (the team)
- **Amenities and Membership Offerings Standardization:** Coordinate with franchisees to standardize amenities and membership offerings, including collecting photos of amenities for the new website. (the team)
- **Review Implementation for Website:** Implement review functionality on the new website design to address franchisee feedback and improve SEO. (the team)
- **App Adoption Tracking:** Track and report on the adoption rate of the new app among franchisee groups and identify barriers to adoption. (the team)
- **Preferred Vendor List Consolidation:** Ensure the preferred vendor lists are consolidated and communicated to franchisees to prevent unauthorized adoption of new systems. (the team)

**Transcript (voice memo)**

My match can give you on real quick. You know, bio introduction of themselves. Ultimately, there are consultancy, right, for the one one system project. This is not an audit to see, you know, how good we're individually doing so much as a discovery of, hey, what's really good and what's not so good, right? So to be honest on all opportunities with regards to what you guys are working on the projects that you have, the technologies that you have, their shortcomings, what's super manual, you know, all the things. So you bring up the opportunities for improvement as much as the, this is what's really working for us really, really well. And I'm sure they'll challenge you and say, you, what's your vision for digital, you know, one year, three year five year from now? overall, you know, those kinds of things. So just not to compete in a natural flowing, you know, conversation. Oh, what I would start. Oh, God, there's a lot of issues. Just kidding. No, there are. I mean, lots of opportunities. There's opportunities and there's gaps, just at the nature of where we are and trying to add to these things. It's going to pull. I mean, as it relates to this project, you know, we have to serve both corporate and franchise locations, right? So we are ultimately the down system to a lot of other systems. And when I say this, I mean, we have we integrate from a website standpoint, from a Jordan online perspective. Motion's off ABC from a CRM perspective, we're sending free pass leads to upspot ClubS, Clean Taft, G sales, and Gmail, if we have nobody or the gym doesn't have like a CRM or anything. So, you know, just in terms of the discrepancy and how we operate is huge, which, you know, I think that's why we're doing this, is because, you know, Jim Pacific Northwest names their annual fee annual fee, and so we set up the website to ingest that information. and then when we go to say, hey, we're going on board Gold Gym, Tennessee, and they have a different nomenclature within ABC of that fee, we're like, that fee doesn't exist because we're not picking it up. Well, actually, they have it, but it's named something else. And so, you know, just the discrepancy in there on what that the true nomenclature of these different fees are. The next thing I would say is, you know, from a billing perspective, from a membership perspective, we're also asked to bring in, you know, monthly fees or biweekly and nobody has, you know, a set way of doing things. And so, you know, from an API standpoint, this really confuses the hell out of us, just like fees, because we can say, hey, we're gonna again, adapt for monthly fees and then we go into bieekly dues. And so it's just like across the board, what's the standard and what can we do? I mean, there's a million different ways that people both operate ABC and then not that they operate most so many different, but you know, that Moso has regarding those that information that ABC doesn't like salespeople, campaigns. It's a lot of information that, you know, we just are asked to normalize. And so from our standpoint now, I'm trying to make back end infrastructure for the digital environments to say, hey, collect this information. So it's all brought together prior to getting to us, and that was, you know, through a, hopefully a CDP that we're looking at for 2026 to you know, normalize some of this. Well, that's not the CDP's job. The CDP is also, you know, the one that we're looking at can be kind of a light data lake to help us with some of this. And so, you know, there's a lot of back end infrastructure that we can accommodate for with having disparate information, but it would help. if we had it all the same. Yeah, a lot of challenges. different back end systems and even within ABC and most, I'm sure the different operators call things differently and have different packages. Hoppers. Conversations over the years, you know, some of the people at ABC, Crystal Steele being one of the account support people for a lot of our golds brand. She's like, wee would love for you guys just to normalize within ABC.. You know, just like everyone, like supporting you guys, everyone does everything different and there's no consistency. So their back off of support team, whether it's, like I said, a lot of our franchiseises utilize their services for cancellations, suspensions, freezes, collections, all the things, everybody has different rules, and they have to have a playbook of rules per franchisee for their support system, which I'm sure probably churns a lot of people, just the nature of those types of jobs. Having to be like, oh, this franchise, you do it this way, this franchise, you do it this way. So there's just no consistency even to Alex's point, even in that particular platform. It's not the difference between motion softed ABC. It's the difference between motion soft, ABC version 1, version 2, version 3, on and down the road for the 50+ franchisees that are on it. Right, It's just crazy. Yeah. Even down to classes like some, you can have a class in ABC as a class, but then it could be an event. Also, So, like, we're picking up classes, well, some people have their classes as events. And so when we look to, you know, put that on the website, it's like, well, what do we then pick up as an an event or is it a class? Back to that point, you know, there's a thousand different ways that we trying to normalize this data the website. So you have the free pass joint online and like class schedules. Can people book online or is it just.. They should be able to book through the app. So we did the website as just like a traffic generator to where, we didn't have class booking initially. It is something that we're working on with the new website revamp that we're working through right now. To have booking through a website as well, yeah. Currently no logged in state for a member. It's very much a prospect based site, generate traffic as opposed to go back to the site, log into the site, interact with the site. Most of that focuses on the mobile side.. I think that brings up the back half of just the privacy and the data needs behind the website is having a single signed and state that, you know we need to operate from one central hub of all of the membership information to, you really have the data governance that we need to have, because you know, as we look as we look at this site, the goal was to go international. And if we're trying to go international, we're gonna be out of compliance from a data standpoint with GDPR, with all of the international laws that we need to have that single signed in the state to help us from a privacy standpoint.. And the mobile app, is it just one app, or is it everybody has the opportunity to do their own app? They do. Yeah, we're trying one app, but we just rolled out motion by to replace. EG. The old net pulse, I think it was, right? And so attracting them to our solution is a struggle if they're using aana, which has their own F peak, has their own F, or they've gone and they've showcased and built, you, some of their own stuff, because whether it was out of necessity, like a support, all the usual regions as toy, they would want to lean in themselves, but now it's creating value, right, a Gnostic approach, like a motion vibe and then bring them over, you so that even if we have dispar systems like we do today, and we continue to have or certain moregin of time until we get one, you know, that's I can see Alex has got a full day with both Jonah line free pass in the app, trying to get all of the franchiseises to lean in on those things. But just as we talked about at dinner last night, it's my opinion that those two platforms, the Jonah line and the app, our biggest opportunities early this next year to really create value and trust with our franchisees, with what we put in and how we get them on board and onto that, such that they don't want to do anything other than be a part of that. So how can we be best in class and those two verticals, even though we do have to spare systems in the back, while we build the data link, while we build, you know, some of these other solutions that begin to unify other processes, but can we really, really lean in on these two as the focal points and then move to the center, you as far as what we're flipping out and unifying? We did have a goal for Jordan Online to have all franchiseises integrated by January As we've seen, you know, we probably took about a three week timeespan from initial discovery to on board because we thought we had everything figured out, with ABC. We did it. So, needless to say, like, we still have probably a majority of the franchiseises that just haven't on board it because we've had to make these incremental adjustments as we've moved down this. This joint online path to be like, OK, Pacific Northwest, you do it this way, we'll make sure and cod it this way for your gyms, and we can do that because we operate on different subsites for the franchisees, like Mike has his own login to his dashboard for his gyms. And so we operate that way methodically for that, but at the same time, like, we just have to have it together. It's an interpretive iteration with every franchise, how you configured, what's your naming standard for, these items that have to be typical items that have to be displayed, pre-purchase inFTC, right? It's like, what is your recurring d? What's your upfront do today? What's it comprised of? What's your annual fee, right? So if they don't name all of those things consistently, that's that interpretation that has to be done per franchisee to. It's not plugged play. We learned that in the last session and as new promos come out, it's not plug and play. There's a lot of manual stuff that you have to do. If you had to put just a date and time and effort measurement, Alex, how many franchisees are outstanding for Jo online and how much time per franchise do you feel like you're taking? So you said, if your entire team did nothing but join online, how long do you think it would take you all hands on deck? For every to incorporate everyone that's left? Yeah. So we have three that are outstanding right now. Pacific Northwest is pretty much wrapped up. We have the Idaho gyms that are on standby, and then we have the Richmond, Virginia gyms that are directly behind them. So, I would say if we had to get everyone on board, I would probably say it takes. It should take us only three weeks per franchise to get this done. From initial discovery, here's your memberships. We'll bring them in, we'll set another call to say, "Hey, here's what it looks like. That was our normal operation. Here's what it looks like," And then go live, let's test Week two, go live on week three. So those three are the only three remaining? No. Those are the only three that we have in the pipeline. There's still more that are outside of those three. We've only integrated Tennessee, South Texas. I think? Yeah, North Carolina, you have them already own right? No. You don't think Carolina's on there? Okay. They're on Peak, right? They're on peak, but they when I talked to Q, he said that, their members are going to their line, and it's connecting in and Pete, but there's things that he wants to change about how his clubs are displayed. So I just assumed that meant he was So let's go back then what's your backlog, your total backlog of franchiseises that are not on Jonah line? All of them but those three. So you, but there's ones that we've put off on purpose because like DC is like, they'll have hourly flash sales. They're like, you know, four Yeah. And it's just like, how we there's also g franchiseises that have hundreds, to 300 memberships in the back end through ABC and we can't pull all of those memberships to our back end because it's too much. It's too much. And I believe ABC also has a configuration mechanism to say what's offered online or in gym. So. But they had never had the need to utilize that flag, right? And so it's one of those things that even that is still a process to work with them, to try to say, can we figure this out, narrow it down? You go click all the right buttons to limit only these to being online, everything else is in gym, and only displaying whatever your top three or five. Yeah, so right now, the one still waiting are 24 groups total.. But that's because we've I've waited for this normalization, because it's just too much. It's too much from an SA standpoint for us to go now go in and be like, okay, month one, we're trying to normalize this API and then month two, we're trying to test and go live. So it's just a two month SLA that I just can't. Well, what. And what you discover in that three-week window and implement based on those rules, all it takes is them going in, creating something slightly different, and then it's broken introduce something new that now doesn't function. And then now you've got the ongoing support of, you know, the overhead and the headache of constantly auditing to say, is it still working as it should or have a configured something that's now broken in? Yeah. So join online, everything's captured within the corporate website. Correct. And other if they're not on that, then it's a jump to their landing cage or something like that. Gotcha. And generally, how do you do that mapping between the back end systems and the corporate website is like naming conventions on the packages or something like that, and that's how you map it to like a. No, we present how you present it on the website. They have their own. Sometimes ABC has a landing page for them. Sometimes they build their own through a vendor. So we just clockporate. The CNS. Here's all the things you can configure to your gym for join online, it's a hop off landing page link. For this, you can go ahead and plug in amenities. You can they have a certain amount of control at their local gym pages through the CMS. Okay, so the franchisees have access to that CMS and they can manipulate. If you want me to bring it up, I can. How much are they doing on their own versus calling you, though, and may have New make changes, though? I mean, be honest. Again, they're not technology people. They're not people. And that's's doing. And that's the other thing that we purposely put this off until, you know, one system is hopefully implemented, but because it's taking Millie so much time to get in and do these memberships, we now have a GDL. I'm trying to hire for somebody from a customer acquisition standpoint, but it's just too much because they are hands off. They go to ABC and they're like, hey, ABC, I want to update my memberships. And then ABC will relay to us. South Texas, here's your new memberships, and then we go live with them. So they don't have anybody that's in. And we don't have a scheduling feature either, so let's not automate it. We have to tell ABC to set it up a day before, so I can have it set up in my back end to then publish it the day of. So the same issue we had in the meeting meeting theosos, that there's no automation, there's no service to precreate and burlow. So you said 24 groups outstanding. If we had a Millie, really for each of those 24 groups because your hands on that, that's the size of team that you would have to have today with current technology and capabilities which is why we have this backlog. Yeah. And I think that point is an important point to loop back as we tile this together for Brad and Danny to clearly understand is, to the point I was making of, despite most of the franchisees saying, I hate ABC, and they take way too much of my money, it's the devil they know, it is this, they are the ones that have that back office support mechanism, and they cater to them, and that's why most of them are on it and haven't been brave enough to jump off of it is because at the end of the day, they do a lot creating their membership plan. I have a new offering that it's going to be $20 versus $40 or it's 20% off whatever. Somebody else does it. They don't do it. And sometimes even though they use a, let's say three franchisees use ABC, they all set up their memberships differently too. So whenever we pull them, even though they're all using ABC, we pull them in differently. Yeah, from a people standpoint, I think eventually it's going to be hit, my team to where it's going to be like, "Hey, we need somebody on my team to be able to go into ABC to update memberships. Because then it's going to be, you know, we're responsible for the front-end production of that. Well, and again, as we go through this process, that contradicts some of Brad's early on, of how far do we go, what all do we do? And again, he's still in learning mode. He's new, and part of this process is discover where we land and what are all the right answers. We, a few years back, I think I mentioned this, built a version when we were on Jonas. We took the exact same platform that we were on from a configuration standpoint. The GL structure, the plans, the memberships, or whatever, that we were familiar with, and we basically said it was called GGPP, the Gold GM Payment Processing. And we got four franchisees to on board onto it, and we basically, for a fee, managed their billing and their environment and all the things. And what it came down to, again, because we didn't hire anybody to necessarily anybody knew to help manage this. It was like,Hey, we're building these clubs, we'll build these clubs just the same, so building can handle it. They know what to do. Kim was involved, you know, from a configuration standpoint, not a huge lift we thought for her. 4 o'clock on a Friday.Hey, I just added five new retail items that I'm not seeing that I need you to add that I sent over the spreadsheet five minutes ago for you to go in and add. "Oh, we have a holiday sale coming this weekend, Friday at 4 o'clock. Please add it in. If became a management nightmare with just those four additional people wanting what they want on their whims, last minute, not. And even though we had a process in place, right? Everybody has a processing. You have to submit it, you, the weeks in advance. Three days in business days in advance, blah, blah, blah. Well, at the end of the day, when they do it last minute, you're not going to say, sorry, screw you in your business, we're not going to do it on your behalf because the custom's always right. And so it became this process of overburdened staff supporting just four franchisees. So again, as we decide where we land, with how much we take on, what we do on their behalf, because if ABC is not the choice for the overall company, a lot of these other players don't have that same back office function for them to opt into. Who picks it up? They don't want to do it. They're not going to hire somebody to do it. We can hire people, but how many people, and what does that look like to our staff model that, you know, we can't give every fee back to them, right? So it becomes this, you know, back to that question of where do we draw the line in the end on how much we support and do versus it's this is our play, this is our text act, but you've got to get in there and live in your own world and configure your own shit and do your own stuff. Hire somebody, outsource it, whatever. So it either comes as it's a service for a fee, so we can recoup those cost of the employees we have to bring on or we have to figure something else to be on the. It's going to be either here or it's going to be on the vendor side.? ABC is going to offer up those professional services, and it's going to be part of this ass, or we're going to offer this professional services going to be part of our tech fee. But it's going to live somewhere.. And we have to that's, again, why I push that conversation with Brad ever so slightly and he's like, oh, I don't know what I don't know, and now even the offic sporting close his mind, I'm sure he doesn't even know your backlog, and he doesn't know the intricacies and why it's unsustainable for you to even start to do these other 24 groups. It makes a lot of sense now why they're not there, because you don't have a team big enough to do it, and it's not normalized. So I think one of the big takeaways for me is as we start into this project, even as we may be looking for a replacement of ABC, I think a crucial conversation with ABC about normalization sooner rather than later is something we run in parallel. In fact, when we have the conversation with Mo and what's his name at the tech conference, they are these are this is the chief revenue officer and the chief Strategy strategy, you knows right well, right? He admitted ABC as a group, treats us as a bunch of individuals, not as a brand. He's like, wee admit it. We haven't done that. And I'm like, "Well, it's really no fault of your own, because we're not your customer at the corporate office, even though we're the franchise or. I mean, it's a two sided, right? So I think my point here is, we may have to, within our change management, maybe push do some changes on your behalf, in ackn everyone's behalf in ABC to potentially normalize, or we absolutely know for sure, then, right? Well, historically, we've probably lived at ABC two or three times under different leadership on, hey, most of our franchiseises are on, it seems like the no-brainer to get us on it, we're all consistent. And those of us that were more in the know were like, yeaheah, every franchisee is on it, and none of them talk. You can't go check into their gym, you can't collect money for their members, you can't do anything on behalf of their members. They're all independent silo or whatever. I'm like, so even us getting on it still would require a base implementation of a normalized environment with a standardized gel structure and I think they call them cost centers and you see, that is like everybody then has to migrate out of their independent silos into this system. So it's still a huge undertaking for everybody to be on ABC for it to be valuable to us as the franchise or. And one of the things our biggest stopping point of not even going any further was the fact that you don't see directly what your revenues are before they take their cut, you just get the aftermath, and reconciliation is very difficult. That's the complaining us for.. And it was the lack of ability to get into and have the data readily available. And supposedly, they've come back and said, well, we can provide you, you know, the full data replicated, no problem. So, yeah, they're willing, I think, to play ball and, you, go through some processes to get their environment what's right for us, if we want to go down that path with ABC, but when I was talking to revenue officer, I was kind of like, I said, okay, here, you want to takeaway?" I said, "Here's the problem. You got to go figure it out, because you have us all independently, you have them at these, oh, you only have two gyms, so your price point is way up here, and your price point is way up here. DC Metro, you got 20 gyms, you got a lower price point, right? SoCalib negotiated pretty decent low rates or whatever. For us to say, we're going to collectively all get on ABC, all that revenue that you have way up here for these guys is all going to go down here because economies of scale for our greater business, this is where we're going to land in order to have a deal. And so you're going to lose money, at least initially, on taking our business as a whole. And they were like, good point, you know, like, we'll have to think about that and how we accommodate that and is the loss worth, you know, the initial loss worth the business for the long term gain. And I'm like, it was the demise of one of their salespeople that Brian O'Leary, right, used to spoke for Jonas. When he got hired by ABC, you know, he came to me, he's like, "My sole job is to get goals of business." I'm like, "Well, good luck figuring out how you're gonna go present something that's a revenue loss at least day one, because all these high rate individuals are going to come down to a lower, you, base rate for the entire business. And he's like, hey, I think, like within eight months to a year, he's like, yeah, I'm no longer with him. We' br around. But back to the people's side, I think, yeah. If we we normalize operations with an within any system. It's a little more scale. It's Exactly. It's more scalable, so we don't need as many people. I mean, if we say, "Hey, you're set. National offers X. Yes, you can drill in from a flash sales standpoint, from a localized standpoint of like, "Hey, if DC Metro wants to run a spread of like, $12 per month, they can do that within, those normal operating costs that we set. But where I come from in the automotive, it's like each individual franchise has to lad up to those national offers, but then they can play around within their local, their local set. Let mention this earlier, do you know our take rate for how many participate in the national offer? Because I thought melody when moreine is like 25% operate. It's number lot. It's yeah. So we've just got, and again, it goes back to we do our business better than you guys do. Corporate's not going to tell us what to do. So the fact that we're trying to get them all in a platform with a common play has got to be very compelling that we're doing it right, supporting it right, have the resources to support it right in order for them to want to even opt into this concept.. Did you mention there's a new website being done? Yeah. It's, um, we're doing a redesign. We just launched the website like a year ago, but it's just, it was five years accumulating. Creative, and it just is not functional for the. In an owner that was heavily involved in what he wanted in direction that is now deceased. The original, Rainer, the original RSG owner who died in the plane crash a couple years ago. So much was hinged on these very personal conversations of, "Oh, I want this, I want this." And so everybody's like, okay, whatever you want. And it just snowballed into this craziness. He passed, people came in the picture, it was like, okay, we got to be a little bit more reasonable. We got to get budget and scope and accountability of things in it. It basically morphed from this monster that had already been started to a smaller scale rollout and some of the things, you know, kicked to the curve and then, you know, Alex, you been here, what, two year and a half almost two years? Two years as of eight days ago. Yeah. So, you know, he basically came into a half baked cake that was strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, batters, all mixed together that tasted like shit, and tried to make sense of it. baking a cake that actually had a piece of taste. I have to wear pictures of the best. And so we' trying to their own, but get them all together and they taste like shit. And where we're trying to go at this website is a very performance driven website, and, you know, it's going to ladatter into this project too, because from an adractability standpoint, everyone needs to be on the same system in order to do this. And so, you know, just, I'll share with you guys how it looks. Don't let it leave this room. But, you know, just from a performance standpoint, this is a lot more conducive to, like, what we need to accomplish instead of what exists there currently. So these are location pages as we're incorporating the wood wall. You can see the the amenities that are going to be behind here Users can click in and see, those amenities as well. So this is another point that we need to get on the same system because these amenities need to be the same for this website. And we need to say, hey, franchisee, we have these amenities go take pictures of them in your gym and we can get those on the website. They can take a dip into more photos here, but the main thing here is these these memberships and, you know, we have to get to a point where, you know, these are performance driven, and by that, I mean, as soon as I enter this page, that user has to be intrigued to take the next step. And so, you know, these, that's what this is being designed for, but this system has to, you know, ladder up to that in terms of membership offers right now. It's like, what are we doing? Like, outdoor workout area? Is that a membership benefit, or is that an amenity? So, like, we're trying to normalize those operations here because we the franchisees are just like, hey, month to month is an actual membership init. I'm like, okay, cool, but what about what they actually get access to instead of like lounge area as an example? So, you know, that's we're trying to make this for the ind user more streamlined from a performance standpoint. But yeah, and then the booking features, so, you know, getting on the same schedule to where these schedules can actually interact with the end user so they can book. And yeah, that's pretty much it. But the design here is a lot different. I' say the schedule, it's also different companies too. Or franchise use. Is it or is it just motion vibe? No, they used a friend scheduling systems as well. Yeah, so Not everybody has their schedule. Corporate Gyms are on motion by ABC as what I was saying earlier, were somewhere labeled as a event, some are labeled as classes. So we had to pull those on. But yeah, just from a here. Except for for the schedules, ABCs, the system of record or it's Correct. For franchisees. So it's just, you know, we need to get better with this, and I think getting better with this is means we standardize our offerings, to the end user, it's more streamlined. There's not a lot of guessing. And then from an ad performance standpoint, that helps conversion rates as well, because that user actually understands what's going on on this website, sort of just like, oh, I can go to I can go to Texas Gyms and they look this way. Well, when I go to Tampa, there's one thing on that page, and that's because, you know, we just can't standardize their page form. Yeah, yeah. What's the website TextDec? So, right now, we are operating on WordPress as our CMS. The server is through a Polish company called Servbo. We're looking to turn that on its head and probably go with AWS as our server, just from a cloud computing standpoint to be sources. This is the front end word press two? Yes. HB. Yeah. So we had built this kind of SAS product that exists behind the website where franchisees can operate their essentially everything that they need to operate from a website standpoint there. So, you know, we've we've tried to build this very methodically, so I can go in here and I can be like, "Okay, I need to update my gym hours. Well, all I got to do is click into this gym, and everything that I need to do is here, and this is why we need to keep Wpress is because this is more like a SAS product that's built on top of WordPress. But all the technical tie ins are WordPress. So then, why I want to keep this is because this has to also let her into the mobile app. So they have one source of updating all of their information, and they don't have to operate outside of that for gym hours or anything else. What is this built on? What are we using? W. Word press. That's Word press. It's. It's not. It's technical tie in as WordPress, but it's technically a SAS product. We don't have like, a platform for it. It's it's just. It's just natively coded. Yeah We created our own We would classify this as a CMS. Correct. It's a native database table. It's CM. All the gym information with the front end is the word press CMS, but yeah, it's all the homegrown customized, the back end is where press my sequel to. Exactly. So, you know, all the technical tie ins, like, you know, everything that's updated here has to go to workPress and. So, yeah, everything is configured with the workpress. Is this today, tie into the CMS for the new app? Or is it separate? Yes, it does, because all of this information goes to airtable an airtable is where all of that information is. So airtable is the source of truth, is the source.os? Correct. But this is where they're updating. I understand, yeah. Oh, okay, so the back end for this right here is air table. It's. Airtable is just where the information is set. Right, right. Now, this this is the traditional My Sequel database, where this is stored that pipes into air table simply because air table for its ease of tapping into without a lot of technical coding, allows a quick, you know, loop bend for the app to hit it, we decided. anything else? Iss replicates to airt.. use that. So then the airt becomes that location data source of truth for all of the external sites. Like, it's also a reputation management is built into, but this is their source of updating. Gotcha. Gotcha. And then for the website, are you capturing analytics, doing any kind of.. UTM codes and Singles and anything like that? We have a lot of information built through big query, and I was just trying to get into this today, and I couldn't, but essentially, everything for me we have mapped through big query, all of the all of the normal website vital information, but then it dives into visitors, free pass, and then from so franchisees can go into their individual dashboards and see, okay, I had X number of visitors. Here's how many took a free pass, and then they can break down the data even further in terms of like region Zip code for targeting purposes if they want to let that into search as well. Gotcha. Just Google analytics. Yeah, so GA4 is the capture in the big query is the.. That's where they can. Do they're slicing and dicing, yeah. So, a big question. difference between this and existing, does that solve whatever the problem is of franchisees building their own sites? It's, they build it, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, with these latest creative needs that we're updating with the relaunch, we're hoping it mitigates them want to go and build their own websites. And why do they want to do that in your opinion? Because that's what they're accustomed to. They're like, "Hey, we've already done it, here's, you know, yes, this site is great, and we've shown them, like, performance data., you know, hey, here's, here's where this site is out performing yours and so on and so forth. They're still like, well, I can update, you know, this and it's what I've used for. They also have more control when they do it themselves, such as, you know, how things are built on the website, how it looks, you know, the colors, some of them aren't even brown colors and they just have more flexibility to do what they want versus on our platforms. But it's never been a source of, you know, us pushing them to jump onto this website, because why would they? That's why I'm hopeful with this relaunch and how this looks. And I mean, they can customize, they can customize heroes, they can customize photos, that they're gonna be like, okay, this is way better than what I have, what you guys have currently, so I'm gonna make the job." And the the crux of some of this is for everything we do to accommodate the disparate systems that they're on, is almost a takeaway to say, why would I ever, you finally gave me what I wanted, a full integration with the system I'm on in the way I do business, why would I want to ever jump to the one system now? So it's kind of like his point of saying, you know, how quickly do we try to get all these integrations done for ABC? You know, do I just let it ride till we get, you know, I don't know that we can wait for a one system before, you know, that's just still realistically, you know, beer, year and a half coming to fruition at best. So it's kind of like, we still have to make progress in the world we live in today, but the more progress we make to accommodate their needs. Kind of is a detractor from the big picture of one system. So what percent of franchisees have their own website? Best guess? I mean, I have a small sample size of a tie. Um. I would probably say north of 900. Okay. No, do they use that as a website or do they use ours? That's, you know, the next question, but. 90%? Yeah. It was they have their own website. Yeah. I mean, obviously, the the power of the brand, you know, just from a globalized standpoint, people like, you search for Gulj,Gs.com seems logical, right? But in localized marketing, if they're saying, you know, like DC Metro, right, goal Zoom, DC Metro, probably everything that they advertise, everything that they put out, everything that they're doing from, you know, any sort of paper click or any sort of advertising is probably to their localized website simply because.. sounds likeurious. Yeah. And that's where they'll give us is like, hey, they have better performance out of my website, but they're driving media to their websites and all their ads are going directly to their website. Yeah, but we're like, hey, here's the organic data, you know, any good platform, you know, there's always that halo effect of paint media to organic media, like,. And we need to target both, and they just don't understand what they don't understand. They just look at, you know, their performance and like, hey, I get more leads out of this site. Why would I make the job? And, you know, we can't really combat that because, again, they're driving media to it. Yeah. Well, they also have their own up spot or a glean tap or whatever, right? So it's not like we're unifying, you know, that that way, the funnel. Yeah. That's where the free pass integrations would come into point, right? What percent are doing a custom custom app right now? Kim did a custom app.. Well, she got the app. Oh, she did. I would say there's easily. over 20 to 30 different goals gym apps published out there. And part of it is because, again, a lot of them of them are on ABC, and so ABC bought Train eyes, and they're like, you can have this fully integrated talking to, you know system, which is more appealing than, oh, when I sign up for the app, it doesn't already know who I am, I have to identify what club I belong to so it knows what system to go look me up to get my right information versus I signed up and I got a direct link that already has created behind the scenes a username and password kind of thing. I mean, there's benefits to it, like, same with Hana, right? It's like part of the process is you get the app and it's already, you know, you've already created your login through the joining process, and you immediately step in the app and knows who you are. For us, you got hundreds of members signing up at all different gems, at all different locations, on all different vendors. They download the main goals gym app, and it's like, who the hell's Ryan Witt? Who does he belong to? I don't know, I need your barcode. So I can say, oh, what's your home gym? Okay, now I know this home gym is in New York, and they're on ABC, and I need to go to the ABC platform in order to find you look you up and serve up certain information specific to your membership. So it's, I think the same obstacles for drone L exist for the app and when it comes to our franchisees, the app. want a little more control or like even c's response down in North Carolina. It's like, we want to do our own website because we want to showcase the fact that when you join one of our locations, you are a member of all of our ownership locations, you get it. It's not a home gym only. And I'm like, are you saying that we can't give that detail on our page, on your behalf? It's like, I don't think so. So I don't know something else. We have our. Yeah, we have, I mean, we have the ability to do that through the JOL. I mean, it's easy. I was just going to say, the app adoption we have 28 groups and four groups have expressed interest in making the day one job, and we've trained them. So that's 24 groups right there that possibly have another app and or just not interested in the app. So you know, DC Metro has been very successful since they split off. They purchased some of the people that used to work for, the corporate, were involved in that split off process, So they knew our back office operations and how we operated. They took a lot of that footprint, that model and that corporate structure, re implemented it, but they've done a lot of different things, and they're doing very well. They're doing very successful, and I've probably looked at their site, I don't know, over the course of the last couple of years, 15 or 20 different times, just what are they doing? What are they doing? And every time I go, there's always this banner, always cheeking down. I've only got 11 more hours to take advantage of a deal. And it's like, it's kind of like, all right, how gimmicky is that? But it must be effective. A lot of marketing people will be like, "Th is this is a garage sale. This is not how you want to do business. It's, you know. But they're doing something right. But the ind user always knows that there's always going to be a flow sale. Yes. And so Y Joy now when tomorrow it could change? Yes. And so, this doesn't make any sense. And we lived in, I mean, the fitness industry as a whole has lived in that month in closeout concept of, all right, it's, let me give it a few more days to be it close to the end of the month. You know, and they'll probably throw out a special to clothes in the month hard. It's like people, I don't know if they're still true to it but it's. I think it's. I mean, I took the Pete, you, Halo series and one of the biggest takeaways when looking at a lot of the case studies, you know, for the very successful brains that are out there, they they're unapologetic in their price. They just don't discount. This is our price. Because it devalues the brand at the end of the day. Right, I mean, it's one of Dean Giamunda's biggest thing, you know, with the SoCal group. They were basically a high volume, low price model versus we goals, charged to $49 a month. And give them the gold's experience for the money kind of a thing. So one of my main was is like, stop discounting. I mean, when I was here last, you know, as far as an employee, every week we were trying to figure out a new way in the joint online was like less than 3% at the time of overall sales. But yet every week we had to churn out a new something, right, to and yet it was doing nothing. And they were like, why are we making this so difficult for ourselves? So we talked a little bit earlier kind of the beginning last night, how can we simplify as we know, as we go into this? Well, and what, again, there's a lot of things taken into consideration, right? You've got a brand new crunch that just opened up across the street, you're going to have to have some competitive pricing to keep your members that are out of obligation when they can walk across to and bringing location. Granted, they might be fed up with crunch after six months and be back, but that's the reality of competition and how you have to weigh that in. But a lot of what you'll hear from, at these tech events and these industry events, and not just tech, but just industry in general, is those that, to your point, that don't devalue their product, not only are they still making the sales, but those members typically stay longer. The commitment to a higher price point or an upfront fee. Those members typically stay longer. They're in it, they're in it. They got more skin in the game, I think it's part of it.. They'll lean in it harder if they spent $90 up front than free. Well, it was free. It's not costing me anything to quit or not really take it seriously. Oh, I just spent $90, I need to get my $90 out of this. When I bought my first outdoor TV that I've put on my patio, I looked at like I Googled outdoor TVs. Oh, there's this brand called Magnolia that sells a 32 inch for 1,700. Walmart's got a TCL that's a 65 inch for $300 I'll willing to take the risk on the $300 TV and if it craps out in the year, I can buy seven more once a year for the same price of this little tiny ass outdoor magnolia rated, you know TV that's supposed to be great. So again, skin in the game, I was like, I'll sacrifice $300 to see if this will actually work as an outdoor TV, and not burn up, because of the weather or whatever. And it actually function really well. And I think that's part of it is people are like, you know, they are people that are willing to pay because there's more of a commitment than like, yeah, I'm willing to, you know, you discount it down to give me my first two months free and then it's only $199 a month., I'm will to, you know, to buy that price, whether I use it or not, they're not engaged, eventually, they end up quitting, right? So, I don't know. I think there's value to not devaluing the brand and just not knee-jerk reaction with price. Oh, we got to generate more revenue. Like, hold your course. I mean, that's a leadership decision. ultimately, but, like. In this in those were-jerk reactions? In this website changed, did anybody pull or talk to the franchisees about what features they wanted? Like, I'm just comparing DC Metro right now if the post, like reading reviews on theirs, not on this one, whatever. Like, do we know what gets them to switch? So, yeah, it was it was done before me, and so I had to go through all the footnotes, of course, but the design was pretty much decided on. So we just had to carry that forward. That's why with this new design, you'll see review implementation as an example because that's one thing that I would really, yeah, we need. We need that. And from an SEO standpoint it makes sense. So yeah, we kind of did a rediscovery with this in this. We have a digital task force with, you know, four franchisees that, you know, we report to you on a regular basis for, like, website feedback, have feedback. And so it was brought to them like, hey, what do you need in order to make this website efficient? So that's how these new designs were. The timing on this rollout? We are targeting early Q1, 2026. There's a few other pages that we've got from a franchise growth standpoint that a history, and then the location pages are next. Is there an expected take rate or a objective of 100% conversion, are you guys thinking you're gonna 50%? Well, we have the FPCs are saying,Hey, we need this in order to, you know, communicate effectively to the franchisees. So they're a pivotal part in getting this adoption, and so, yeah, I think the expectation is, you know, the four digital task force members speaking for the majority of everyone else that they cascade to, you, the other franchise. So we're working through those channels to get that take rate to be higher, but from what we hear, this is needed. Everyone wants to consolidate. They don't want to have to pay X amount of dollars to run their own site and so it's you know, the writing is on the wall in terms of adoption for the for that. Development is in house, or you guys are? We partner with a team called STRV. They are out of Prue, and so they have development resources of Prague, but they also have them in our time zone as well. So the initial before Alex came in, the initial team that was the internal digital team was heavily influenced politics by RSG Germany, Germany's marketing team on design, content, the look and fuel of the site, Again, some of that rainer before his passing, for the most part, it's full control on our side now, where we're I guess there's still some aspect of marketing, I guess that comes out of Germany, right? But for the most part, we we have full autonomy. We're doing our own thing, which is a better place to be. So yeah, a lot of their idea of a website was what looks pretty regardless of functional. Not even looks pretty. It's true, true. Their ideas is like a very flat page of just, you know, and obviously websites here are more driven by content SEO and, you know, we need to account for these different core web finals that, you know, we know that websites are ranked on as it comes to the search engines and they don't have that in the EU. So, you know, it's this very flat. Join, and that's pretty much it. I think a good thing, too, on our website is where we are 88 complianant too, and I don't even know if franchisees websites on. Yeah, and they don't that's the other thing is AD8 compliance is huge with us. and so, you know, if.. And they're like, American disabilities Act, we're not American.. All we care about is GPR. Yeah, but they're also now the EU is down on the ADA and so, you know, they have to do it. But from a franchise standpoint, it's like, they don't know these little intimate details that we know, like, hey, you have to be ADA compliant. They'll just throw up a website and not even matter. And so and then when they get a lawsuit, it's like, you know, well, shoot. I know the LA, the SPal group, they were just like, we'll just pay it. It doesn't matter. And then just get it to go away. So these little things are like things that, you know, are hidden costs that they don't necessarily know about or not taking into account. All right, we're pretty much at time, any other nuggets of gold, I'm sure there'll be an additional follow ups. So time. based on other discoveries and questions that need to be asked, but any other major nuggets of gold as far as like here's something, you know, that's broken gaps, way we work, way we want to work, it's worth noting. I don't think so. No? O who manages, like, the ads that are the contents, the and you work with the franchisees on that? So we have a an ad service company calledW promote. And so what they do is in houses that creative, so creative team here develops the ads, and then they push it to W promote and then W promote's the one that controls the cost and everything. Wromote just took over from MMG, and so those operations might be a little bit different. MMG has been with the brand for about seven years. Eight years, maybe even longer, yeah. Yeah, so, you know, we are we don't. My team doesn't handle performance. We're more so just like maintenance of website. Gotcha. The scary part that we won't ever talk about in front of a franchisee is a lot of like, what we talked to Robbie about. the strong model. Kind of newly introduced. Like, we're finding and shaping our model. A lot of what we're doing on digital is new partners we're picking for certain things are all new or whatever. We want to be able to say we're trying and true, we know what the hell we're doing, and the reality is, we're kind of in learning mode and revamp mode ourselves. So we have to make sure that as we go through this process that you know, that we're picking the right partners, doing the right things, setting the right operational process and procedures and SOPs and all those things, and that we're comfortable with it because if six months in, we're like, oh, everything we just talked about, we're going to rip and replace, you know, because we decided we're doing something different. It's like, they're just going to be like, oh, another round of BS from Golds corporate, like, you know, like the cycle Stud example I gave earlier was, right, where it's like, just, is the agency doing just corporate or corporate at national? So the franchisees have the ability to opt in for them. But you still run national campaigns? Correct. via that agency? Is that agencies in what channels is that performance market? Do you have any? So it is socials, it is. Like Facebook, everything. Paul of that. Not TikTok because of the pixel. Snapchat.. Yeah, it's met. Oh, yeah. But then we'll also do like forums, so like Reddit and stuff like that. and then Google routes of course. That agency's covering that also agency is focused so. But the franchise is, they do have the ability to go local with their ads, and they can say, "Hey, I want X partner. Like, we have companies that use ROR, and ROR is part of, you know, the tech act that integrates with our tag management system, so it's fine. But they also have the ability to use W promote as well, but W promotes the national campaigns, and then if they want to go local, they can use W Prote as well, but they don't have to. But you guys use W promote for a corporate, though, too. Correct. Yep. You have to approve all vendors? Um Or can they just I know often think so. We should, I don't believe we do. Yeah. They what you'll hear consistently throughout of this is franchisees have pretty much had the autonomy to do whatever they want, even in the last few years where we've imposed more rules and regulations as we try to, like, start to tighten things down and get to a common ground, they do what they want to ask for forgiveness. We give them a light slap on the wrist and say, you shouldn't have done that, but we're not going to make you undo it'cause you spent money and time and already doing it. So it's. Well, we also had two different preferred vendors lists, and they just now brought them together. I remember how Don was talking about, how Yeah, we had, well, yeah, so we have two vendor programs, right? Iris was known as the GPP Gold vor program, where we pick certain the no brainers, right? The equipment providers that we negotiated, large skill deals with, but you know, ABC, peak only because the Carolinas went to peak before they asked for permission, so we said, okay, well, peak's pretty cool, we'll include them. Right. And because most of them on ABC, so ABC peak, I don't even think we're emotion soft is even a part of it, even though we're on it. you know, and then, like Kimberly, like, I'm Duke on it, I don't really appreciate she pulled a peek. Yeah. I think she pulled in Caroline. Yeah. And so it was again that, oh, you shouldn't do that, but we're going to create this letter saying, please do not jump onto any other systems. We've approved this person to pilot Hana on our behalf. No, we didn't approve shit. So, yeah, I mean, they've just had the autonomy to do anything and everything in some of these franchiseises that, you know, have been with the brand 2030, 40 years, when it was more licensing than anything, just they go, they slowly develop what is their business model and it's not a standardized goals sponsored business model at all. Okay. Okay, we're six minutes after. Thank you. both so much.. Thank you. Appreciate you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Good to meet you guys. Nice to meet you too.wise. Thank you. I'll have to follow up.
